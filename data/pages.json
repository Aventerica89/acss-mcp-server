    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageOne of the most common accessibility mistakes in web design involves clickable cards and content groups. When you wrap a card or group of content with a link, you physically contain multiple pieces of content within the link. This is inadvisable for two reasons: Nesting block content (images, headings, etc.) within inline elements (a link) is bad practice. Grouping more than one piece of announced content within a link creates poor accessibility. When users with assistive technology focus on your link, the assistive technology will do one of two things: It’ll try to announce all announceable items, or it’ll simply read out the hyperlink with no additional context. Both outcomes are confusing and annoying to users. Additionally, your link will have no technical or semantic meaning because it contains too many different items. Here’s a video that covers this topic in detail: Stop Making This BIG Mistake With Clickable Cards (Use \"Clickable Parent\" & \"Focus Parent\" Instead) - YouTube An Example (Right vs Wrong)​ Here’s a card that is wrapped in a link. Use a screen reader or Apple Voiceover to interact with it. You’ll see that the accessibility is poor. Clickable Card​ This is a sample card with text. Everything is wrapped in a link, which causes screen readers to try and announce everything. It’s super annoying and technically wrong. Below is a card that uses the “clickable parent” technique. Focus on it and hear how it’s announced. The assistive technology will announce it as “clickable card.” Clickable Card​ This is a sample card with text. It uses clickable parent, so only the heading is announced. It’s much better. Imagine this was a service card in a grid of services, with the card heading being the name of each service. When using Clickable Parent, assistive technology will properly read out each service name, making it very clear to the user what they’re interacting with and where each link will navigate to. Additionally, for contextual purposes, SEO, and general page indexing, the link’s anchor text is 100% clear and exactly matches the destination. This is how links are supposed to be structured. The Approach​ You can’t wrap a group of content in a link, but you still need the entire group of content to be clickable, right? To accomplish this, we need to add a link to the heading of the content group and then extend its clickable area to fill the entire card. This is done using an absolutely positioned pseudo-element. You don’t need to know all the technical details of how to implement this. You just need to know that ACSS provides two utilities for easily doing this. We also provide an additional utility that will change the focus behavior of your clickable content group if desired. The two utilities are: The Clickable Parent utility class​ To use the utility class, create a card or group of content and then add the destination link to the heading within that content (typically an or ). Next, add the class to the heading. Since we’re using an absolutely positioned pseudo-element, the final step is to change the position of the parent container (the container which contains all the children of the group – the thing you want people to click) to position relative. If you don’t change the parent to position relative, the clickable area of the link will extend beyond the bounds of the content group and affect other elements on your page. This is undesirable, so don’t forget to set the parent to position relative. Congrats! Now you have a clickable content group (a clickable parent element) with the correct link structure and accessibility. Note: Sometimes builders set certain elements to position relative. Anything that is position-relative is automatically elevated above the clickable area. This will break the clickable nature of your content group. It’s essential to ensure that all elements within your clickable content group are set to position static (this is the default position so it’s typically not necessary to do this manually). The Clickable Parent mixin​ The downside to using the clickable parent class is that you have to apply it multiple times if you have multiple clickable groups (like cards in a grid). This isn’t very scalable or maintainable. If you have multiple clickable content groups and are using BEM classes, you may want to opt for using our Clickable Parent mixin. Note: This mixin must be added to a SCSS stylesheet. It will not work in a vanilla CSS stylesheet. If you’re not using SCSS and aren’t familiar with SCSS, then stick with the utility class method above. Here’s an example of the Clickable Parent mixin in use: Note: The mixin should be used on the actual or element. That’s it! Clickable Parent in Bricks Builder With BEM Classes​ Not using SCSS, but still want to use clickable-parent with custom classes? In Bricks, you can easily do this with the new %root% selector in the CSS input of any element. Just assign this CSS (we recommend adding it to the parent element, especially if you’re going to be using the Focus Parent technique: Let’s assume you have a card with a clickable heading (typical use case). Here’s what it would look like (assuming you’re using BEM and gave your heading the class structure of : Notice that I have selected the actual clickable element, which, in this case, is the element that’s inside the heading. If your clickable element is a button, you would simply select the button. Focus Parent​ It’s common to want to combine the clickable-parent technique with another technique called focus-parent. Where clickable parent extends the clickable area of a link to cover an entire parent element, focus-parent alters the focus behavior of that parent element and its children. In other words, the focus-parent technique also allows your entire clickable element to be focusable. This extends the same click and hover effects that clickable-parent provides to keyboard users. Learn about focus-parent Wrap-Up​ 95% of web designers fail to implement clickable content groups correctly. The result is poor link structure, semantic structure, and accessibility. With ACSS, you can structure things properly in seconds with minimal effort. This is yet another example of how ACSS promotes best practices, helps enhance accessibility, and helps you build better websites with less effort.",

Changing Focus Color on the Fly​ The default focus color is not always appropriate. For example, if your focus color and background color are the same, focus can’t be seen. This creates an accessibility problem. You can change the focus color of elements in any box (and all children) using focus classes. They use the syntax with all active colors and shades as options. Additionally, since all focus styling uses the local variable , you can simply assign a new value to anywhere to change the color on the fly. Focus Parent​ When using the clickable-parent technique, you can also optionally set focus on the parent using the utility class.

In other words, the focus-parent technique also allows your entire clickable element to be focusable.

Both classes will remove focus from the link within the content group. There’s no right or wrong here. It’s user preference. All you need to do is apply the class to the parent element (the same element you set to position relative). The Focus Parent Mixin​ Much like the Clickable Parent mixin, the Focus Parent mixin allows you to manipulate the focus styling of a BEM class so you don’t have to litter utility classes everywhere. Using our example above, here’s what the execution looks like: As with the utility class, your options are “shadow” or “outline.” Focus Parent in Bricks Builder With BEM Classes​ If you need to assign focus-parent to a custom class in Bricks Builder without using SCSS, you can use this code snippet on the parent element class: The first instruction removes the focus styles from focusable children, and the second instruction adds a box-shadow focus style to the parent element. You could optionally use the outline style by replacing the second instruction with this: Whether you use the box-shadow or outline focus style depends on the situation and the effect you’re trying to achieve.

Outline uses the CSS outline property. Shadow uses the Box Shadow property. The advantage of is the ability to offset the focus ring from the element in focus.

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageCreating clickable elements without discernable text is a common accessibility mistake in web design. An example would be a group of social follow icons. The developer will add the icons to the page, link them to various social profiles, and then move on. The problem is that assistive technology cannot announce what these items are or what they’re for. Instead, the element will be announced by reading its raw URL. This is a definite accessibility violation. There are two solutions: Use an aria-label Use hidden accessibility text Of course, aria labels aren’t without downsides: You can’t always add an (if the builder doesn’t allow you to access the relevant part of the element or doesn’t permit you to add HTML attributes in a given situation). Aria labels often aren’t translated by translation tools. Aria labels are often hidden and forgotten, creating disconnects and improper aria text when pages are edited. A simple alternative method is the use of hidden accessibility text with the utility . Using the Hidden Accessible utility class​ Let’s continue with our example above. You want to link a social icon to a social profile. Here’s your HTML: Again, screen readers and search engines have no idea what to do with this. However, if we add text inside the link, the text will be announced and used as an anchor link: The link will be announced as “Follow us on Facebook.” While this solves the accessibility problem, it creates a new UX/UI problem. We don’t want the text here! It breaks the design. This is precisely where we need to deploy . I’ll break the HTML up into multiple lines to make it easier for you to read: Hidden accessible hides the text from sighted users while retaining the information for assistive technology and search engines. How do I know there’s hidden text if it’s hidden?​ Good question! You’re right to be concerned. If you deploy hidden text everywhere, you might forget it’s there. Then, when you make changes to a page, you might forget to update the hidden text. This would be bad! Thankfully, we’ve already thought of that. Unlike similar classes that hide text for accessibility purposes, Automatic.css deploys an accessibility icon next to any hidden text when you’re working in the builder. This icon alerts you to the presence of hidden accessibility text so you can remember it’s there and remember to update it as needed.",

Doing this requires specific CSS on the element in question as well as CSS changes to the direct parent of the element. In Automatic.css, it’s achieved with one simple utility class: . Making a real image a background image​ Advanced developers often want to use real images as background images instead of using the CSS property. This is because real images have a number of advantages: they’re indexable, they’re compatible with lazy load, they can have alt tags, they’re compatible with src-set, you can make use of the tag, and so on. To make a real image a background image with ACSS, add an image element to the page (often in a section), and then add to the image. That’s all there is to it. Now you can add additional classes to the image, like overlay classes, object-position classes, flip classes, opacity classes, etc. Make any box a background​ is compatible with almost any element. This means you can take a blank box and make it a background. Then you can style the box however you’d like. If you add a blank box with immediately after your image that’s also using , the box will act as an overlay on that image. You can actually stack layers indefinitely like this. How works​ The utility works by positioning the element absolutely, forcing its dimensions to match the exact dimensions of its parent, and setting the z-index to for infinite layering without affecting content or other features like overlay which occupy the layer. It also identifies the direct parent, sets the to and creates a new stacking context using . All values for are tokenized, with the real values being added as fallbacks. This means you can interact-with and easily override any of the tokens: – defaults to absolute – defaults to 0 – defaults to 100% – defaults to 100% – defaults to 0 – defaults to -2 – defaults to cover (only applies to images) – defaults to center (only applies to images) Yes, this means you can also get creative with how your background elements behave/appear/animate.",

For this reason, ACSS features a global border system to establish: Global Border Radius Global Border Width Global Border Style Global Border Color (Light Version) Global Border Color (Dark Version) Global Border Styling Let’s take a look at how all this comes together and gets used throughout your website. Global Border Radius​ What you need to know: Use whenever you need to create border radius. It’s uncommon to use different radius values throughout a website (with one exception). Therefore, we should have a single radius token that stores our primary radius value. ACSS uses for this. The exception is with a concept called concentric radius. Unfortunately, concentric radius values can’t be mapped to a single variable since they’re heavily dependent on context and knowing the values of local elements. For this reason, we’ve introduced @recipes for creating concentric radii. Note: If your website’s design does not use border radius anywhere, set this global value to “0.” Auto Radius​ You can automatically add your site’s default radius to elements programmatically by turning on the “Add Radius Automatically” switch and targeting specific CSS selectors. ACSS Auto Radius Option By default, we add radius to (image) and elements that don’t contain images. You can add any other selectors here that you’d like. Just make sure to wrap each selector in quotes and comma-separate them. Global Border Styling​ What you need to know: Use , , or whenever you need to add border. Aside from border radius, creating a global border style involves three properties: Border Width via Border Style via Border Color via or ACSS allows you to set all three of these from the dashboard with color having both light and dark variations. These properties combine together in a global variable called var(–border). This allows you to add your global border style to any element like this: The global border style is either light by default or dark by default, depending on what you choose in the dashboard. If you need the alternate version, you can simply call it with its own variable, like this: You can also modify the border style per instance by modifying the tokens locally (should only be needed in rare cases): Global Border Style + Global Radius​ Keep in mind that border-radius is not part of the shorthand border property, so it’s not included in . In order to get an element to have both the global radius and your global border style, you need to declare both, like this: Border Classes​ ACSS 3.0 introduces three classes for applying border styles: Unlike , the border classes do apply both the global border style and global border radius at the same time.

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageDividers in web design are elements of design that tend to be consistent throughout an entire website. For this reason, ACSS features a global divider system to establish: Global Divider Inline Size Global Divider Size Global Divider Style (Literal) Global Divider Color (Light Version) Global Divider Color (Dark Version) Global Divider Gap Global Divider Style (Combined) Let’s take a look at how all this comes together and gets used throughout your website. Global Divider Style​ What you need to know: Use whenever you need to reference your global divider style. It’s uncommon to use different divider styles throughout a website. Therefore, we should have a single divider token that stores our primary radius value. ACSS uses for this, a token that is designed to be used with the CSS property, like this: The color of your divider is dependent on whether you used the light or dark divider color in the dashboard for your primary style, but you can always call the alternate version by using the color specific tokens: Of course, that applies the divider style, but creating the effect of a divider requires spacing between elements. This spacing is mapped to . You can use this token however you see fit as there are many ways to achieve the spacing required for dividers. In some cases, you might want to use a pseudo element without the use of the border property. In these cases, you can use the divider tokens by themselves, like this: Just note: If you don’t use the border property, you won’t be able to apply to achieve border style variations like dashed, dotted, etc. Divider Classes​ ACSS 3.0 introduces three divider classes: will apply your global divider style to the top of an element, along with your desired gap. will apply your global divider style to the bottom of an element, along with your desired gap. is a programmatic utility class that will apply dividers and even gaps between all direct children of a parent element. Note: This technique uses programmatic margin rather than gap to ensure the technique works in block-level elements. For this reason, if your parent container is using flexbox/grid and gap, you should set gap to “0” to ensure that spacing is consistent. Altering Divider Instances​ Whether you’re using variables or classes, you can re-map values on unique divider instances by redefining the value of the tokens locally. For example, let’s say you use to add a bottom divider to an element. But, for this one particular instance, you want to set a custom color. To do this, simply redefine the value of . Just make sure you’re using other divider tokens where possible to keep various styles hooked into the global divider system. In the above example, is a custom color being used in place of the normal divider color. By using and , you’re able to keep those aspects of the divider hooked into the global divider system.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this page Inverted radii are not a native feature of CSS. Therefore, inverted radius implementation is typically quite technical and time consuming. But, with ACSS’ Inverted Radius Framework, you can implement inverted radius in your designs in seconds with no technical understanding of the technique. Identifying Inverted Radius​ Before you can implement inverted radius, you have to be able to identify it when you see it. The example above is created with a box that groups “Card heading” and the card text together. That box is positioned at the bottom of the parent box. Padding is added to the box to create space around the content. The top two corners of that box are normal radius. You can achieve it by applying radius to the top left and top right while keeping the bottom left and bottom right radius at zero. The bottom two corners have an inverted radius that fold back into the parent. This is the part of the design that’s not natively achievable with the property in CSS. Any time you see a border that curves away from the box that appears to create it, that’s an inverted radius. Activating the Inverted Radius Framework​ Since you won’t need inverted radius on every project, the Inverted Radius Framework is off by default. You can turn it on by going to Borders & Dividers > Additional Radius Options > Inverted Radius Support. Once that’s activated, you’re ready to implement inverted radius wherever its needed. The Inverted Radius Utilities​ Inverted Radius is applied purely with data attributes. There are two attributes per corner, one for positioning and one for slicing, and two total corners available for each box you need an inverted radius for. Yes, these are long attribute names. We kept them like this because we’ve found that abbreviations do more harm than good. And since this technique is saving you hours of time in most cases, typing a long name a few times won’t kill you. Here’s the rationale: is a required part of the name according to the spec. describes exactly what you’re doing, and we couldn’t think of any way to shorten this in a non-abbreviated way. and are the corner you’re targeting. and are the action you’re taking. As you can see, it’s about as short as you can get without abbreviating it into an unrecognizable and unreadable convention. And if your attributes are unreadable and uninterpretable by others (or by yourself six months later when you return to update the project), that’s a bad thing. Preparing to Apply Inverted Radius​ It’s very important to know that inverted radii in ACSS all reference a token for background color. This token is . The inverted radius are expecting a value for this token, so you should start by defining the value at the parent level, wherever it makes the most sense. In the example above and below, we want to use inverted radius to create a cutout effect. This means the content box and its inverted radius corners need to match the background of the section the entire element is in. Thus, we gave a value at the section level and then set the background color of the section to . The color of the radius edges and the color of the box that the radius edges are attached to automatically adopt the color once you define it, so there’s no need to set these colors anywhere else. Adding an Inverted Radius​ Inverted Radius is applied to the box that the radii are curving away from. This is the box you will apply the data attributes to. In the example below, the data attributes are applied to the block that contains the card heading and card text. Before you can add the attributes, though, you need to be able to properly visualize the inverse radius effect. When you apply the data attributes, you’re essentially positioning invisible boxes where you need the radius to be and then you’re slicing off the corner of the box where the radius needs to appear. Since this technique uses pseudo elements, you have a max of two corners you can set. This is typically all that’s needed anyway. There are two data attributes per corner: and . This is because you have to control the position of the corner as well as how the corner is sliced. Positioning an Inverted Radius​ Let’s talk about positioning first. In the above example, corner is placed on and corner is placed on the . When it comes to positioning inverted radii, there are 16 options: This is why visualization is important. Study the example above and notice that the box visualizations are clearly aligned to the bottom on both sides, but are still inside the box, vertically speaking. Next, they are positioned left and right to the outside of the box (on the inline axis). The syntax is pretty simple. The word “outside” immediately follows the direction where you need outside placement. would place the box at the bottom, on the outside, to the right where would place the box at the bottom, on the inside, and then outside to the right. Here’s : And here’s : As you can see, proper placement is critical. One position will create an inverted radius and the other will do nothing. Use this box visualization model in your head as you’re preparing to create your inverted radius – it helps tremendously. Here’s what it looks like in code to add the data attributes: Note: You can easily apply data attributes in advanced page builders as well, but you’ll need to add them through the Data Attributes UI for the selected element. The code example also shows the slice instructions, which we’ll discuss next. Slicing the Corner​ Once you position your box correctly, you need to “slice” the proper corner. For slicing, you’re simply telling ACSS which corner of the box the radius needs to apply to. This part is the easiest as there are only four options: Use the box visualization method, it should be pretty obvious which corner of the box needs to be sliced to create the intended effect. You slice the box using the attributes with one of the above values. Changing Positions at Breakpoints​ In some cases, you may want to change the position of your box as well as the inverted radius corners at a different breakpoint. Not only is this possible, it’s made easier by the tokenization of the framework. There are three variables that control each inverted radius corner: You’re already familiar with and , but we haven’t discussed yet. The inverted radius technique is mostly an optical illusion that’s accomplished with box shadow. When you use the data attributes, the box shadow is handled for you, but when you need to manually adjust a corner at a specific breakpoint, there’s no way to handle that automatically. Thankfully, it’s super easy to manage this on your own. The and properties share the same options for how they’re applied and they just need to match. There’s really no additional thinking required. Here’s an example of moving a corner on devices 767px and under: Whichever side you is the same side you . Easy! The values are the same as when you were using the data attributes, the only difference is that when you’re calling tokens by name, they’re prefixed with either , , or . Dealing With Visual Artifacts (Rare)​ Depending on the specifics of your design, you may run into visual artifacts that look like this: The artifact renders as a very faint half pixel “eyelash” which is actually part of the photo we’re using as the background. You might think that this is due to some math discrepancy or overflow issue, but it’s actually just a browser rendering issue. It’s fixed by identifying the element in your design that is causing it (like the image in our case) and forcing the browser to use GPU Acceleration by adding a GPU-enabled property/value pair. For example, adding the below line to the image in the above card solves the artifact: Support for Gradients/Patterns/Textures​ There are two primary methodologies for creating inverted radius. One is the technique we’re using in ACSS (the “shadow” approach) and the other is a masking technique with SVGs. Both methods have pros and cons. The benefits of the shadow approach are: No SVG files needed Radius is dynamically flexible and referenceable. It’s easy to implement with the framework. The benefits of the masking approach are: Works with background gradients and patterns/textures. Neither approach is right or wrong, you just need to know the limitations of each one so you can choose whatever is the most appropriate for the scenario you’re trying to solve for. As long as you don’t need compatibility with gradient or texture backgrounds on your parent element, the shadow approach is by far the best approach. If you do need compatibility with gradients and textures, you’ll need to use a masking approach which is not currently part of this framework. Support for Clickable Parent​ It’s possible to use clickable parent on a card that is also using inverted radius, but it requires a very specific structure and has definite limitations. Since both clickable parent and inverted radius use pseudo elements and absolute positioning, there are three general rules of thumb: The clickable parent link cannot be the same element that has the inverted radius, nor can it be a child of the element that has inverted radius. The clickable parent link must wrap the box that creates the inverted radius and cannot be positioned relative or absolute. This is only viable if you plan on using a heading as the only content, otherwise you’re defeating the purpose of clickable parent. Here’s an example of a working structure for clickable parent and inverted radius: The “Link Wrapper” is positioned at the bottom by the card’s flex alignments since you can’t use absolute positioning for this. The heading wrapper is where the inverted radius are defined. This works because there’s nothing stopping the clickable parent’s clickable area from extending to the entire card. If you want to put additional content in this card, it would need to be placed in a separate area from the heading, which you are free to position however you’d like and could support additional inverted radius on its own.",

For a seamless experience, please make sure you’re using the Premium/Pro versions of both products. Caution: While ACSS is compatible with Generate and its workflow, it’s not the best possible development experience. Among all the possible ACSS-compatible platforms, Generate is the clunkiest. We only recommend Generate if page building in the block editor is mandatory. Otherwise, your best option is Etch or Bricks. Etch writes all of your content to the block editor using native blocks so your data is still liberated, “close to core,” and easily editable in the block editor. Installation​ Install GeneratePress theme (free) Install GeneratePress Premium Plugin Install GenerateBlocks plugin (free) Install GenerateBlocks Pro plugin Install ACSS Customizer​ Most of the GeneratePress setup happens in the WP Customizer. You can get to the Customizer by visiting the front end and choosing Customize from the wp-admin menu. Once the Customizer is open, follow these steps: Colors Delete all global color swatches Remove all default global styles by deleting the value of each swatch in each category. Layout > Container Set the container width to your site’s content width. Unfortunately, this has to be a static value as Generate doesn’t allow a token value. Please tell their development team to improve this. General Underline links > Never Full-Width Page Building​ To use GeneratePress and GenerateBlocks for page building, you’ll want to choose some specific settings in both ACSS and the block editor. ACSS Settings​ Make sure the following options are set in ACSS under Options > Gutenberg: Load Styles in Block Editor = On Use Block Editor for Page Building = On Generate Color Palette = On Replace Color Palette = On Class-First Workflow = On Block Editor Settings​ When you open a page to start page building, you need to remove all the clutter that Generate adds. You can do this by selecting the following options: Sidebar Layout > No Sidebars Content Container > Full Width Disable Elements > Content Title Section Element in Generate​ Generate does not have a element. They unfortunately use a generic container element for everything. This means that sections have to be created by flipping a switch manually and adding and inner container manually. Start by adding a container element to the page and click the icon to add an inner container: Next, you can turn the outer container into a section element by choosing from the Advanced > Tag Name in the sidebar: Once you change the tag to , you’ll see that ACSS automatically applies your default section padding. Adding Classes in Generate​ There are two places to add classes in Generate: Gutenberg’s class input and Generate’s selector system. The Gutenberg “CSS Classes” input is where you should place utility classes. If you right-click this input, you’ll see ACSS’ utility class context menu for easily finding, previewing, and adding utility classes. The Generate selector system is where you should add your custom BEM classes. You can then use ACSS tokens in the styling inputs attached to these classes. Right clicking a styling input will open ACSS’s token context menu for quickly adding tokens to inputs. You can now build completely custom pages from scratch in Generate, powered by ACSS.

Activating Gutenberg Support​ By default, Gutenberg support is turned off. Open the ACSS dashboard and navigate to Options > Gutenberg. There, you’ll find the options ACSS makes available to you to make the Block Editor behave in a more predictable way: ACSS Gutenberg Options Load Styles in Block Editor — ACSS will render styles associated with utility classes and variables inside the block editor. Use Block Editor for Page Building — ACSS will make the block editor be 100% width (like a blank page canvas) so you can build a page with blocks properly, without worrying about the inside-out approach to styles in Gutenberg. Generate Color Palette — ACSS colors, shades, and transparencies will be available in the Gutenberg editor color palette along with any other colors generated elsewhere. Replace Color Palette — ACSS color system will fully replace all existing site color options. Class-First Workflow — ACSS will move the Gutenberg classes input to the top of the block editing window for faster, easier access. Pages, Posts, and Custom Post Types​ By default, ACSS is available in both posts and pages, but with a critical visual difference. Since pages are prone to being used for literal page building, the page editor will render full-width. And since blog posts are prone to being used for actual blog posts, the post editor will render the standard center-column narrow layout that you usually see in the Gutenberg post editor. Additionally, support for custom post types is not available by default. Adding Support for Custom Post Types​ To add support for custom post types, add the below snippet to your functions.php file and add the ID of all CPTs you want to add support for, separated by a comma. “Page” Block Width & “Post” Block Width​ Gutenberg controls the width of elements in the block editor by setting a max-width on every element and then inline-centering every element. The width of elements is a fixed value. To provide users with more flexibility, ACSS overrides this default static value with a value you can edit in the ACSS dashboard: Gutenberg block width settings in ACSS In fact, we give you a value for each of two contexts: pages and posts. Page Block Width sets the width of blocks when editing pages and Post Block Width sets the width of blocks when editing posts and custom post types. Of course, there are often times where you want a custom post type to behave like a page. In these cases, you can tell ACSS to make blocks for those post types equal to page width blocks. This is what the “Page-Width Post Types” input is for. Just append the slug of your post type, e.g. “events” to the class and wrap it in quotes. Comma separate each post type class and then hit save. Example: Of course, you have to make sure you have activated ACSS for those post types using the code snippet from the previous section. That’s all there is to it.

Warning: These files should be used to start a new project. Uploading them to an existing project will overwrite your settings and defaults. Step #1: Import Bricks Settings File​ Download this Bricks Settings Blueprint file (.zip), unzip it to expose the .json file, and upload the .json file to your Bricks Settings Panel: Step #2: Import Bricks Theme File​ Bricks uses Global Theme Styles to control a lot of your website’s default styling. Most of this should be left undefined, but a few settings need to be set up. Download this Bricks Theme file (.zip), unzip it to expose the .json file, and then upload the .json file to the Bricks Global Theme Styles area. Open Bricks Builder by editing any page or template. Once in the editor, click the settings wheel toward the top left: Bricks Global Styles Create New Theme Style in Bricks Upload Bricks Theme Style JSON File Once you’ve uploaded both files, you’re good to go. You can now proceed with customizing any empty settings based on your preferences (such as setting your font family in Typography > Body/Headings).

Once the panel opens, click the plus sign to add a new theme: Create New Theme Style in Bricks Give your Theme Style a name and click “Create.” The first thing you need to do is assign your new theme style to your entire website. You can do that in the Conditions tab: Bricks Theme Style Conditions Warning: If you don’t assign your theme styles, you won’t see them at all and ACSS won’t work properly. Make sure you assign the styles to your entire website. Warning: These settings should only be used to start a new project. Changing them on an existing project will overwrite your current settings, all your headings that aren’t individually set will become h2. Importing templates that don’t have explicit settings will also use your defaults. Here are the rest of the settings (panels & settings that aren’t mentioned require no changes): Typography: Set your Font Family for both body and headings. Typography (Required): Set HTML Font Size to Element – Container (Required): Set width to Element – Code (Recommended): Set theme to Tomorrow Night Element – Heading (Recommended to ease workflow): Set default Tag to H2 Element – Image: Set caption to no caption Using these settings means headings will be h2. When the defaults are not what you need, change the individual element after adding it. Caution: Setting other global styles in Bricks can cause conflicts with ACSS. Make sure you know exactly what you’re doing if you want to set any other global style defaults in Bricks. That’s it! Bricks is now setup and ready to work properly with ACSS!",

Install the Automatic.css. Configure your desired settings in Automatic.css. Breakdance doesn’t load any intrusive global styles by default, so there’s nothing else to do. You are free to start using ACSS features inside of Breakdance. In fact, we recommend not setting any global styles in the global settings area in Breakdance — Automatic.css already sets all of the global styles you need. Builder Notes​ Please be aware of the following idiosyncracies related to Breakdance: Sections & Section Padding​ Breakdance uses a different section structure than recommended and doesn’t provide users access to the inner wrapper. For this reason, you’ll need a slight shift in how you manage section padding. The normal padding input fields won’t work for changing section padding because these inputs are linked to the inaccessible inner wrapper. ACSS puts padding in the actual section element where it’s supposed to be, so to change section padding in Breakdance you’ll need to use one of two methods: Use utility classes. Use the padding inputs attached to the section wrapper element in Breakdance. Here’s a look at the wrapper inputs you’ll want to use:",

We highly recommend you switch to a modern, forward-thinking, and forward-moving product like Etch or Bricks. Our Official Position on Oxygen Compatibility​ The Automatic.css framework, including many of its newest features, still work just fine in Oxygen. The new 3.0 dashboard loads in Oxygen and supports live preview. Some builder enhancements like Auto-BEM are available in Oxygen as well. With that said, we have officially ended our commitment to ensuring that new features are fully compatible with Oxygen and are not prioritizing testing or bug fixing in Oxygen. Any potential issues related to security will still be addressed. When Oxygen was first announced as legacy in June of 2022, we advised all customers to begin the process of switching to a new builder. It has now been more than two years since that advisory notice (which we repeated dozens of times over this two year period), which is plenty of time for users to take the necessary and appropriate action. While most third party developers immediately abandoned Oxygen, we maintained compatibility for a full two years. However, maintaining this compatibility with the required testing, bug fixes, and time required to ensure all the new features work going forward is not economically feasible.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageAutomatic.css officially supports Cwicly as of version 2.7. Please follow the instructions below for proper setup. Step 1: Install Cwicly​ For a smooth setup process, install Cwicly before you install Automatic.css. Cwicly needs to exist when ACSS is activated so that ACSS can check for the existence of Cwicly, pre-load utility classes, and automatically activate various aspects of the framework. Official Cwicly setup instructions Step 2: Install Automatic.css​ Download and install the latest version of Automatic.css from your account dashboard. Remember, you need v2.7 at minimum. Step 3: Turn on ACSS Support for Gutenberg​ Cwicly is a Gutenberg-based builder, so we need to make sure ACSS Gutenberg support is activated. Head over to the Options tab in ACSS and turn on Gutenberg support. Ensure all settings in the Gutenberg area are set to “On” except for “Class-First Workflow.” By default, Cwicly has a class-first workflow, so we need this setting off. Step 4: Configure Cwicly Admin Settings​ In the WordPress admin, go to Cwicly > Settings and open the “Advanced Settings” panel. Here are the recommended settings to confirm: Remove List Container = On Remove Classes & IDs = On Cwicly Defaults = Off Remove SVG Filters = On Remove WordPress Global Styles = On Remove WordPress Emojis = On Remove Gutenberg Template Part Wrapper = On Remove Container Block Display Properties = Off All Deprecated Settings = Off Step 4: Configure Cwicly Builder Settings & Global Styles​ Open Cwicly by editing a page. Once the builder loads, navigate to the Settings Panel: Breakpoint Setup​ Cwicly and Automatic.css must use matching breakpoint values. The actual values are up to you as long as they are identical between Automatic.css and Cwicly. One challenge with Cwicly is the lack of additional breakpoints. Automatic.css has four breakpoints by default, with support for up to six breakpoints. Cwicly only has two breakpoints. By default, the “Tablet” breakpoint in Cwicly matches the “L” breakpoint in Automatic.css with a value of 992px, so you don’t have to change that one if you don’t want to. The “Mobile” breakpoint in Cwicly (576px) doesn’t match any ACSS breakpoints by default, so we must adjust this. In our experience, 576px is too wide to get a good feel for how your site will render on most phones. We recommend changing this breakpoint value to match ACSS’s “S” breakpoint (480px). Backend Setup​ This is not required for ACSS, but we recommend clicking on the “Backend” icon (the one in the middle) and then setting Dark Mode to “Dark” and “Inspector” to “Left” (optional). Setting the Inspector to the left will give you a more traditional page builder experience, though many Cwicly users prefer the inspector stay on the right since that’s where the block inspector is natively in Gutenberg. Font Setup​ Next, navigate to the Typography Settings area by clicking the “A” icon. Set your preferred font family for Body and Headings. We recommend making sure all other inputs here are unset. Automatic.css will handle all text sizing, line height, etc. for body text and headings. Default Element Behavior​ Cwicly allows you to set some default styling on certain elements. We recommend you set default styling on two elements in particular – the Section element and the Container element. Navigate to the Elements Global Styles panel by clicking the 3D box icon. Then click the “Section” icon in the middle. If this area is blank, click the “+” icon to add a new element. Add global styles for a Section element and click on it to open the styles panel. Once the styles panel is open, click the “Layout” icon. Set the default display property to “Flex” and the default flex-direction to “Column.” This will make it easier to use the variable to space out your section’s inner containers. Next, click the icon for the “Container” element. Again, if this area is blank, click the “+” to add new global styles rules. With the styles panel for Container open, click the Sizing icon. Set the width to “100%” and the max-width to . This will sync your containers to the website width you set in Automatic.css. Optional: Cwicly Support for Posts & CPTs​ By default, we don’t load styles in the builder on posts or custom post types. This is due to the limitations of Gutenberg to know what type of content you’re creating (an actual post or a page layout). Support for posts and CPTs exists, though, you just have to add it manually. Open your functions.php file and add the following: This allows you to add support for posts/CPTs selectively. We hope to improve this experience in the future. You’re all set!​ ACSS and Cwicly are now ready to work together. You can proceed with the rest of ACSS setup or begin building your site!",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageWith Automatic.css, you can quickly turn any link (), navigation button (), or literal into a styled button with utility classes. Every color set in the ACSS dashboard has a corresponding button style with both solid and outline variants and each button style can be customized. Note: Abbreviated Naming Convention​ Only a few classes in ACSS use abbreviations for the name. Buttons are one of them. Instead of writing .button, the naming convention for all button classes is . Solid Button Classes​ To add a solid button, add a link or button element to the page and then add the class . The link or button is now styled according to the settings you’ve chosen for your website’s primary button. You can do the same with any of the other colors (secondary, tertiary, accent, base, neutral). For most buttons, we recommend using the primary family as this should map to your website’s primary color. Light and Dark Button Variants​ Every button style also has light and dark variants. These are useful for when your button color is clashing with the background of the container. Light and dark variants can be activated/deactivated from the button options in ACSS: These are applied with classes using the syntax . For example, would give you light variant of the primary button style. You do not and should not combine these classes with the main button style class. Use them independently. Outline Button Classes​ A popular alternative to solid buttons are outline buttons. An outline button has a transparent background and colored border. Creating outline buttons with ACSS is easy. First, add the button class for the desired color to your link or button (e.g. ). Now, add a second class . The existence of the class swaps the style of your button to the outline variant of the chosen color. You can customize the styling of your outline buttons in the ACSS dashboard. And yes, is compatible with the light and dark variants as well. Button Size Classes​ Sometimes you want smaller or larger buttons depending on the placement of the button on the page. This is easy to achieve with ACSS using button size classes. As with most things in ACSS, button classes use “t-shirt sizes” (xs, s, m, l, xl, xxl), so they’re easy to remember. If you want a large button, add the class to your link or button. Add if you want a small button, and so on. Wrap-Up​ By mixing and matching various button classes, you can achieve exactly what you want in seconds. For example, if I want a small outline button that uses my site’s action color, it would look like this: Remember, the order the classes are applied to an element doesn’t matter.

They will not work in the builder inputs or builder CSS. It’s common to use 3rd party plugins on WordPress websites or run into scenarios where you need to apply button styling to specific elements that you can’t necessary apply a button class to. Some of these plugins, like e-commerce plugins, form plugins, etc. contain buttons that need to match the style of all your other buttons. This is a perfect use case for a button mixin. Note: Button mixins are part of ACSS’ SCSS structure, so they can’t be used in regular CSS fields. You’ll need to use the mixin in the Custom SCSS area of the ACSS dashboard. ​ The main button mixin in ACSS is the mixin. This mixin allows you to attach any ACSS button style to any link/button element you’d like. You can use it like this: The above code will make exactly match your website’s primary button style. Available Styles​ You can replace “primary” in the above example with any valid ACSS button style: Note: To use the versions, you’ll need to wrap the entire style name in quotes, like this: Dealing With Specificity Issues​ In the above example, could be an element that already has styles applied to it. If these styles contain greater specificity than your CSS instructions, or are placed in a stylesheet that comes after ACSS’ custom CSS, the mixin won’t work unless you increase specificity. One way you can increase specificity without actually altering HTML is to double-reference the selector, like this: Another way you can increase specificity is to use a page builder’s html/body/main ID (if one exists) to start your CSS declaration. For example, Bricks uses an ID on their main tag, so you can use it to increase specificity without altering HTML, like this: If the mixin isn’t working for some reason, or is partially working, you’ll need to calculate the specificity of the default styles you’re trying to override, and then produce higher specificity with your mixin targeting.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageButtons and links are used on nearly every page of a website, so it’s important to set default styles for them. This is easy to do in the ACSS dashboard. Just navigate to the “Buttons & Links” tab. Default Button Styling​ ACSS Global Button Styling Default button styles apply to ALL buttons, regardless of color. Sharing styles across button types ensures that all your buttons will be visually consistent concerning these default characteristics. Main Button Styling​ Button Padding: Set the top/bottom padding (Y) and left/right padding (X) for buttons. “Em” is the preferred unit here as it will cause the padding to scale up or down according to your button text size. Minimum Button Width: Sets a minimum width for all buttons. While buttons can still get wider according to their text, they’ll never be narrower than this value. Do not set this value too high; it can cause horizontal scroll/overflow issues on mobile devices. Button Text Styling​ Line Height: Changes the line height of text on buttons. “1” is the widely accepted standard. Letter Spacing: Changes the letter spacing of button text. Font Weight: Changes the font-weight of all button text. Font Style: Changes the font style of all button text. Text Transform: Changes the transform value of all button text. Text Decoration: Changes the text decoration of all button text. Text Decoration on Hover: Changes the text decoration of all button text on hover. Custom Button Text Size: Turn this on and then set a min/max value if you want the default button text to be something other than the “M” text size. Button Border Styling​ Button Border Width: Set the border width of your buttons. You won’t see the border if your border color is the same color as your button. Button Border Style: Outline Button Border Width: Set the border width of your outline buttons (.btn–outline). Ideally, this value will match your other button border size value. This ensures that all buttons are the same height when placed side by side. Button Radius: Set the border radius for all buttons. By default, buttons use your website’s global border-radius. Button Transition Styling​ Use Global Transition (Default): Use your website’s global transition style for buttons. Transition: If you opt out of using the website’s global transition style you can set a manual transition style. Radius Note: Using classes or radius variables on your buttons are not advisable because this reduces global control. It’s best to set your button radius here in the ACSS dashboard so that all your buttons inherit this default radius and no additional classes or variables are necessary. Available Buttons​ Button styles in both solid and outline variants are available for all active colors in ACSS. Thus, there are 36 total button styles (18 solid and 18 outline buttons) if all colors are enabled. Primary Primary Light Primary Dark Secondary Secondary Light Secondary Dark Tertiary Tertiary Light Tertiary Dark Accent Accent Light Accent Dark Base Base Light Base Dark Neutral Neutral Light Neutral Dark It should be noted that button styling will not load for colors that are turned off in the Palette area, nor will you see options for them in the dashboard. You can also deactivate any button group you don’t intend to use, even if you use that color group for other things. This will reduce the size of the framework. To deactivate button styles, navigate to “Options” in the buttons panel and then choose the style you want to modify: ACSS Button Style Toggles You can choose whether or not to load solid, outline, and light/dark variants. Overriding the Style of Certain Buttons​ Each button group has its own customization area in the ACSS dashboard. Here’s an example of the Primary button overrides panel: Primary Button Styling in ACSS This panel allows you to adjust the following for each button style: Background color Background color on hover Text color Text color on hover Border color Border color on hover Focus color We recommend always using color variables to maintain consistency within the system and to maintain compatibility with color scheme features. Overriding Buttons in Specific Contexts​ ACSS buttons use locally scoped variables (tokens), making them easy to override. You can override an individual button on a page, buttons in a specific section, or buttons across an entire page without affecting other buttons of the same type. To override a button or group of buttons, use a selector to identify them and then redefine the value of its tokens. For example, let’s say you wanted to override the padding, font weight, background color, and hover background color of a single action button on a single page of your site. Just override the variables you want to override at the ID level: Want to make this change across an entire page? You can add a body class (a class on the body element) to the page to affect all action buttons: Now you’ve changed the style of all buttons on a page without affecting any other page of the site. Available Button Variables​ Please reference our button variables documentation for a full list of available button variables. Creating Custom Buttons​ ACSS is designed to cover the basics regarding buttons, which will work for most websites. Create a custom button class if your design requires a super fancy button. By using ACSS button class syntax () all global styles will automatically apply to your new custom button. All you have to do at that point is define values for each styling variable for that new button. You should do this on your new button class with custom CSS. It’s easiest to use a button recipe for this.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageThere’s a big debate on whether it’s acceptable to open external links in a new tab. Accessibility advocates tend to argue that they shouldn’t be used, while UX advocates and most users feel that opening external links in a new tab is preferred. For the record, we side with UX advocates and users who prefer that external links open in a new tab as long as the process is executed properly. How do you execute it properly? There should be a visual cue that the link will open in a new tab. There should be an auditory cue for screen readers that the link will open in a new tab. Only links to other domains should be opened in a new tab (never used for internal links). ACSS lets you apply the visual and auditory cues automatically to any link that will open in a new tab or window with full control over each cue. Turning on External Link Indication​ Indicate External Links Setting in ACSS To activate this feature, navigate to Buttons and Links and then click on the links tab. Find the “External Links” accordion and then enable “Indicate External Links.” Customizing the Indicators​ Both the visual and auditory indicators are customizable via the following controls: Panel for customizing external link indicators External Link Indicator: Accepts any HTML entity code. Indicator Position: Should the indicator come before or after the link? Indicator Gap: Space between the link and indicator text. Indicator Size: Size of the indicator. Indicator Alignment: Vertical alignment of the indicator. Indicator Color/Hover: Color of the indicator on non-hover and hover. Indicator Weight: Thickness of the indicator. Indicator Offset: Y/X translation values for the indicator. Indicator Exclusions (Removing Indication Programmatically)​ In some cases, you might want to exclude certain links, certain link contexts, links in certain areas, and so on. You can use the Indicator Exclusions feature for this. By default, links that wrap images, figures, pictures, and SVGs are excluded via the :has() statement as long as those items are direct children of the link: If there are other objects that you’re wrapping in a link where the indicator should not show up, you can simply add to the comma separated list within the parenthesis. If you want to exclude links by ID, Class, or some other selector context, you can add additional selectors after the has statement, as long as they’re comma separated: Any valid selector will work. Accessibility Text​ The last thing you can customize is the auditory cue. By default, ACSS uses “Link to external site.” When a screen reader reads your link text, it’ll read this auditory cue immediately after so the user knows the link will open a new tab. For example, if your link text is , “this article about Hummingbirds,” a screen reader will announce, “this article about Hummingbirds, link to external site.” You are free to customize this default announcement cue. Also, don’t forget that you’re in full control of the aria-label for any individual link should you need a more precise announcement. Just use HTML or the builder to add your own aria-label whenever you’re creating the link.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageMany users have asked how to approach gradient outline buttons using ACSS. While the ACSS button framework gets you 80% of the way there, we need to add some custom CSS to get the final effect. Here’s how it’s done: Pre-requisite​ Get all your global button defaults setup in the ACSS dashboard. We’ll be setting this custom gradient outline style as the “primary” button style, so make sure “Primary” color is active and the “Primary” button style is activated. These are both active by default in ACSS, so you should be good to go out of the box. Step #1: Custom Background​ Navigate to the Primary button styles panel in the ACSS dashboard. Set the background and background-hover fields to: We’re going to use custom tokens here because we need to declare them as transitionable properties, assuming you want them to transition on hover. Step #2: Declare the Properties for Transition​ If you want to transition colors in CSS, you need to declare them using the new syntax. In the Custom SCSS dashboard in ACSS, define them like this: We’re going to set the to transparent since we need the button to be transparent by default. Step #3: Primary Button Styles​ To make this effect work, we need to: Get rid of the border that’s normally on our buttons Position the buttons relative so they can support a pseudo element Adjust the padding to account for the now-removed border Set the transition for our gradient colors Here’s what the CSS looks like for this step: Here are some notes: We’re declaring the class twice to make sure we don’t encounter any specificity issues. We’re declaring the here. We’re declaring the here, as a new locally scoped variable, since we’ll need to use it in two different places. We’re using ACSS’ and to maintain sync between your custom code and ACSS for transitions. You can always redefine these for your buttons if you’d like. We’re using ACSS’ , , and to maintain perfect sync between your custom code and ACSS for button padding and border width. Step #4: Pseudo Element​ The effect we’re using works by creating a gradient pseudo element and then using a mask to cut a rectangle out of it, giving the appearance of a gradient outline. There are other approaches you can take, but this one creates smoother gradients, maintains proper radius, and makes transitions easier. Here’s the code, which you can nest inside of the previous code block when you’re using the SCSS dashboard in ACSS: Notes: Since and have their initial value set to transparent, we need to define actual color values here on the pseudo element. and work together to make the pseudo element the exact size of your button. creates an offset away from the mask, equal to your outline button border width, giving the proper appearance of a border. The mask is just a white rectangle set to exclude or “mask” the white area. We re-declare the transition here so the gradient “border” can be transitioned along with the background. Step #5: Hover Styles​ Setting up the button styles the way we have makes adjusting hover styles super easy. You can nest this code in your original code block: Notes: Remember, the gradient colors are transparent by default, so just give them values for the hover state. The attaches itself to so you can also give the gradient border new values on hover. These are ideally opposite of the initial values you declared for the border (else nothing will change) and should match the hover color values for the button (so the button background and border seamlessly merge).

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageIt’s common for clickable and hoverable elements to have transition styling. It’s also common for clickable and hoverable elements to share transition styling for consistency purposes. Given this fact, ACSS offers a global transition style which maps to two main utilities: and . For buttons and links, these utilities aren’t necessary because ACSS applies your global transition settings to by default (override available). For other elements, though, you’ll need to apply the transition yourself. Here’s how you can use the transition variable for a hoverable/clickable card: You could also just add to the card, but that’s less efficient than using the variable on your custom class. How the Transition Utilities Work​ The global transition style is set with multiple inputs in the dashboard. Three of the inputs are for your main transition properties: Duration Timing Function Delay These three inputs map to corresponding variables: The fourth input is for assembling the actual transition. You do this by listing the properties you want to transition (e.g. , , , etc.), followed by the references to each of the above properties. Each segment should be comma-separated. Remember: The ACSS dashboard doesn’t require the use of and will strip all instances of . Therefore, just use the variable stems. If you only want to transition the background property, it would look like this: If you need to transition more than one property, use comma-separated values: Warning: The use of “all” is not recommended. While this is easier to write and manage, it can create performance issues. Custom Transitions That Leverage Global Transition Properties​ You’re not limited to using and . If you want to set a custom transition style on an element, but reference specific global transition properties, you can easily do this. In the above example, we’re creating a custom transition with custom values, but referencing global transition values where desired. You can also redefine the variable on any element. This allows you to override programmatic transition styling for a specific element. Let’s say you have a loop of clickable cards that are all using and you want to set a completely different transition style on all even cards. Here’s how you can do this. And, don’t forget, you can calc stuff, too: It’s pretty flexible!

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageThe Automatic.css Card Framework is an innovative new framework for managing card styling . It reduces the amount of work you have to do when building cards, ensures that card styling is extremely consistent, and improves the scalability and maintainability of your sites. Note: This feature is currently in experimental mode while we do extensive testing and adjustments. Settings, variables, conventions, and workflows are subject to change. Enabling the Card Framework​ The Card Framework is turned off by default, though we highly recommend you turn it on. To enable the framework, navigate to Cards from the main dashboard and then toggle the framework on. Card Framework Panel Automatic Card Styling​ Turning the framework on won’t change anything out of the gate. The first decision you’ll want to make is whether or not you want ACSS to style your cards automatically. Navigate to Cards > Options and find the toggle for “Style Cards Automatically.” This setting works by Automatically styling all cards that have the word “card” in their class name. For example: , , , , etc. Using specific class names isn’t necessary, you just have to use the word card somewhere in the name, which is already a well-accepted standard. If you are working on a new project, we recommend turning this setting on. If you’re working on an existing project with existing cards, we recommend leaving this setting off. Excluding Cards From Auto Styling​ If the auto card styling is picking up a class that has the word card in it, which should not get card styling, you can exclude that element from automatic card styling by adjusting the Auto Card Selector under “Targeting Settings.” Here’s the default targeting: Just add any selectors you want to exclude to the list using comma-separation. Any selectors added here will be excluded from automatic card styling. Manual Card Targeting​ If you’re not going to use Automatic Card Styling, you need to use the Targeting Settings to identify which cards should be controlled by the ACSS Card Framework. This is done via the Manual Card Selectors input. There are three approaches you might want to take here. A main card utility class like . If you take this approach, any box with the class of will have the framework enabled and will be styled automatically. A card data attribute like . If you take this approach, any box with the attribute of will have the framework enabled and will be styled automatically. List specific card selectors like . Using this approach, any class listed in a comma-separate list will be styled automatically. How the Framework Works​ Once the framework is applied to a card (either manual or automatic), you’ll see default card styling and can start to manipulate that styling from the ACSS dashboard. For example, you’ll see that the card has padding, border radius, a relative position, clipped overflow, and other similar default styles. These are all very helpful and consistent with the rest of the ACSS framework and are all controllable from the dashboard inputs. ACSS uses tokens for all styling, which are all prefixed with the word “card.” You set your default styles from the dashboard and then are free to make any adjustments you need to make on a per-class basis. For example, padding is applied with , gap is applied with , and radius is applied with . Remember, this is all done for you! You never have to do this manually. Styling Cards with BEM (Important)​ BEM is the best all-around syntax for organizing CSS classes and flattening your CSS. The Card Framework is based on BEM principles and you’ll want to follow BEM practices when using the Card Framework to avoid complications and to unlock additional superpowers within the framework. This is especially true when using Automatic Card Styling. The Card Framework looks for classes that contain “card,” but that don’t have a “__” modifier. If the class structure for an Article Card looks like this, you’ll break the Auto Styling framework: All of those classes contain the word “card” without any identification of which element is a child element. Therefore, ACSS will attempt to style every single one of those elements as a card. The appropriate structure looks like this: This is classic BEM and best practices. Following this syntax will improve the quality of your site and ensure the card framework operates flawlessly. Tip: ACSS won’t style card classes that contain the word “wrapper” or “group” either. This makes it possible to add card wrapper classes without adopting the default card styling. Default Styling, Light Cards, and Dark Cards​ Once you start building your first card, you’ll need to start adjusting the styling to suit the design you’re trying to achieve. For most sites, your cards will either be primarily light or primarily dark. The Card Framework supports both and you can set the most prominent one as the default via Options > Primary Card Style. Default Styling​ Default styling is styling that applies to all cards, whether they’re light or dark. This is things like spacing, typography, border styling (other than color), etc. You can configure all your default styling in the Default panel. The following options are available (make sure you read the details – some elements require specific class names to take effect): Spacing Card Padding – Main padding value for card content. It’s applied automatically to the main card wrapper, but can be removed from there and used in any part of the card. Card Content Gap – The gap between all content inside cards. Is applied automatically to the main card wrapper, but can be applied manually to internal wrappers as well. Typography Heading Size – The size of the main heading of the card, which is identified by . Text Size – The default size of text inside your card. Borders Concentric Radius – Optionally sets card radius using concentric math to improve the radius UI of cards with boxed icons, media, avatars, etc. Border Width – The thickness of the card border (set to your global border width by default). Border Style – The style of the card border (solid, dotted, etc.) Border Radius – The radius of the card (set to your global radius by default). Icons Targeted with Icon Size – Size of the main icon in an icon card, as signified by. Icon Radius – Radius of the main icon in an icon card. Avatars (Photo/Headshot, etc.) Targeted with Avatar Size – Size of the main avatar in an avatar card. Border Width – Border width for the main avatar. Border Style – Style of the border on the main avatar. Radius – Radius of the main avatar (use for a perfect circle). Aspect Ratio – Aspect ratio of the main avatar. Use for circles. Media (Featured Image, Featured Video, etc.) Targeted with Radius – Radius of the main media in a card Aspect Ratio – Aspect ratio of the Object Fit Light Styling & Dark Styling​ Styles that are specific to light and dark variants are set in the Light and Dark panels respectively. Each option has the following settings: Background – The background of your card, which supports any valid background value including images, linear gradients, etc. Heading Color – The color of your main card heading, set with . Text Color – The color of your text. Link Color & Link Color Hover – The color of your links. Button Style – The style of any button in a card, triggered by the existence of any class. Border Color – The color of the card’s border. Icon Style – The style of the main icon, chosen from the Icon Framework. Again, make sure the class name uses . Avatar Border Color – The color of the border on avatars. Make sure the class name uses . Card Shadow – The color and style of the shadow for your cards. By default, if Primary Card Style is set to “Light,” your cards will be light by default and without any additional input. If it’s set to “Dark,” your cards will be dark by default. You can call the opposite style manually on any card using one of two modifiers: – The alt class will flip a card to the opposite style and continue to flip the card accordingly if the default ever changes. or – These are specific classes that will call that specific style and persist indefinitely, completely independent of the “Primary Card Style” setting. If you’re designing a card that’s always supposed to be the opposite from the others around it, use modifier. If you’re designing a card that should be light or dark and never change, use the specific and modifiers. Remember, this follows proper BEM conventions. If you want to use the dark modifier, your structure should look like this: Notice that both classes are used. You shouldn’t use the modifier class alone by itself. Creating Cards​ The card workflow is simple – create cards as you normally do and simply follow the proper BEM conventions. Let the card framework apply its defaults and then override them where necessary. If there’s a situation where you want to reference a card style in a place its not being applied automatically, use the Card Framework tokens. For example, let’s say you want to remove the main padding and gap on your article cards and apply the card padding to the inner content wrapper instead. It would look like this: This might seem like we’re undoing things the framework is doing, only to do them elsewhere. However, you’ll quickly realize that the styling decisions you have to make and properties you have to set are reduced by 80% to 90% when using the Card Framework. Not only that, but all your card styling is completely standardized and globally controllable. Container Query Support​ The Card Framework has unique and simple support for container queries. This allows you to change the card’s design or layout based on the size of the container it’s in. First, enable Auto Container Query Support in Card Options: This automatically gives any wrapping element of your cards a of , opening the door for styling your card with container queries. The easiest way to add a container query is to select the card class you want to style, go to custom CSS, and use the card container recipe. There’s also a card container mixin if you prefer using the SCSS editor.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageThe establishment of proper contrast between foreground and background elements is important in web design, and can be made automatic in ACSS with our unique Automatic Color Relationships feature. Auto Color Relationships allow users to assign foreground styles to headings, text, links, and buttons in relationship with contextual background classes as well as textures and overlays. Once this feature is setup, the use of a utility class like will not only set the background to the ultra-dark color, but it will automatically flip the foreground elements to their preferred values as well. This video will give you additional context and an example of how this feature works: ACSS 101.07.P2: Background & Text Color (Contextual Approach + Auto Color Relationships) - YouTube Setting up Auto Color Relationships​ First, you need to make sure the feature is turned on by navigating to Backgrounds & Text > Options. Flip the switch to turn on Automatic Color Relationships. Auto Color Relationships Option Once this feature is on, two new panels will appear: Light Relationships and Dark Relationships. Configuring Relationships​ Ultra Dark Relationships Panel Open one of the relationships panels and choose a relationship to configure. You’ll see inputs for Text Color, Heading Color, Link Color, and Button Style. If the panel says “Ultra Dark,” it means you’re configuring the foreground elements for an ultra-dark background. In this case, you would use lighter colors or anything that creates sufficient contrast. Use any ACSS color variables in these inputs to configure the relationships. If you want something to retain its default color, like links, you can simply leave the input blank. For “Button Style,” simply use the name of the style, e.g. “primary,” “secondary,” etc. If you want to swap the style to the outline style, just attach to the name of the style, like this: . How to Use the Feature in Your Workflow​ To see your color relationships in action, just add one of the contextual background classes (example: ) to any group of elements. The foreground elements will change immediately. Please note that auto relationships won’t work when using the variable version of these utilities. For example: The above example will not trigger the auto relationship because variables in CSS are simply a token that stores a value. They don’t have any power beyond that to influence other elements and elements can’t be targeted based on the existence of a specific variable. For this reason, you must use the appropriate utility class to trigger the relationships. This is fine, since changing background color is a very popular and extremely appropriate use of a utility class. Frequently Asked Questions & Caveats​ Can I override the heading or text style with a custom class? Yes. Auto color relationships provide a new starting point for the styling. If you need to override a relationship within a single instance, you can do this with a custom class. How can I have two different color buttons since auto relationship overrides button styling? It’s uncommon to need two different button colors next to each other, so the first thing you should do is re-assess the design decision and make sure you’re following best practices. If you do, in fact, need two different button colors next to each other, the easiest way to do this is to add a custom BEM class to the button you want to override and then use the btn() mixin within the custom SCSS area of ACSS, like this: Assuming the auto relationship was set to display your primary button, this would allow you to switch one of them to secondary. You could also do this programmatically by targeting, for example, any second button with an ACSS button class using the new syntax. The above example would target any second instance of a button that exists inside of .bg–ultra-dark and has a class containing (ACSS buttons), and change its style automatically.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageACSS 101.07.P2: Background & Text Color (Contextual Approach + Auto Color Relationships) - YouTube Once you setup your Palette in ACSS, you’ll want to set up Background and Text Assignments. Rather than randomly using brand colors via color-related classes like background color classes or text color classes, Background & Text Assignments are a way to map specific colors to how they’re actually used on a website. When you assign colors to specific contexts, you can build a site without referencing specific colors during the development process. It’s easier to understand how this works if you look at a real example. The light background of that section is the default body background color of the website, which ACSS outputs as , but could easily be referenced with or . The vast majority of the text is dark text, so ACSS uses your dark text default color via . However, some of the text is lower contrast (the paragraphs below the headings). We refer to lower-contrast text as “muted” text and we use or to set these. As you can see, we’re referencing the context of light backgrounds, dark text, muted text, etc. without the need for referencing specific colors. This is because the colors are pre-assigned to these contexts. There are two main advantages to working this way: Less thinking – you can work within the context of “light and dark” without knowing or caring what color you need to use. More theme-ability – you can change the colors that are used on the site without ever replacing any classes or variables. Once you setup assignments and start using them for the first time, you’ll get the hang of it and very quickly see the benefits. Setting Up Background Assignments​ Open the dashboard and navigate to Backgrounds & Text. Choose the Backgrounds accordion: ACSS Background Assignments Start by telling ACSS what your default background color should be. By default, it’s var(–white), but you can use any color. Next, assign your dark, ultra-dark, light, and ultra-light background options. Setting Up Text Assignments​ Open the dashboard and navigate to Backgrounds & Text. Choose the Text accordion: ACSS Text Assignments Start by setting your website’s main text color. The default is . This is confusing to some users because isn’t an actual color. But, stop and think about it for a moment. If your website is light by default, then you’ll want dark text by default. There’s no reason to reference a specific color for this. You can just reference and then assign the necessary color to , which is the input immediately below. Sometimes I make the default if I prefer to have muted text as my default text color. It’s up to you. Point is, there’s no reason to reference an actual color in the “default” field — you can use one of the color assignment variables because those contain the desired color. Using Color Assignments in Your Workflow​ Once your color assignments are setup, it’s important to make sure you use them properly in your workflow. This will ensure that you get all the efficiency and re-theming benefits from them. For Backgrounds, you have four options (plus your default website background). The background options are: and and and and It’s best to apply these with the utility classes, because they support Automatic Color Relationships (variables don’t). Keep in mind that you also have your website’s default background color. Let’s say your default background color is . By not using a background color on a section, it will default to white. So, now you have five simple options for setting background colors across your site. For Text, you have four similar options. The text options are: and and and and You can use either the utility classes or the variables here – both are compatible with Automatic Color Relationships. Using these assignments everywhere they’re possible, dramatically improves efficiency, flexibility, scalability, maintainability, and theme-ability.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageAutomatic.css introduced support for color-scheme (dark mode) in v2.7. It should be noted that this feature is more than just “dark mode.” In fact, the term “dark mode” isn’t a technical term and doesn’t accurately describe what this feature does. Dark Mode?​ Accessibility is an essential aspect of modern web design. One aspect of accessibility is serving a color scheme that matches the user’s preference. Users can prefer a generally light scheme or a generally dark scheme. Users can also prefer other color changes, such as low-contrast. The term “dark mode” suggests that all websites are light, and can be changed to dark with the flip of a switch (or based on the user’s preference). We all know that’s not the case, though. A website can be dark by default, in which case the switch becomes a “light mode” switch. This is why “dark mode” is not a technical term in CSS. The technical term for serving different color modes to the user is . For this reason, ACSS refers to this feature as Color Scheme. Consequently, you can use ACSS’s color scheme functionality for more than just inverting colors. How to Activate Color Scheme​ In the dashboard, navigate to the Palette tab and find the area titled Color Scheme. Color Scheme Panel Activating Color Scheme​ There are two ways color scheme is applied to websites: a manual color scheme switch and which is an automatic transition based on a media query. The first thing that you’ll notice in ACSS is that there’s no actual switch for activating color scheme across the website. There’s a switch for “Auto Color Scheme,” but this switch only determines whether or not ACSS will automatically serve alternate colors to the user based on their operating system preference (via ). The way you “activate” color scheme is by defining an alternate color for any of the colors in your palette: Activating an alternate primary color Any time you activate an alternate color, your website is ready to use color scheme. Now you just have to determine whether you want ACSS to automatically serve the alternate color to users or use a manual color scheme switch – or both. Auto Color Scheme​ Users can set their preference for light or dark settings in their operating system. This is true for desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones. The operating system communicates this preference to the browser, and the site can scheme for this preference using CSS media queries. If you toggle this switch on (it’s off by default), we will serve the color scheme the user prefers (assuming you’ve activated alternate colors). If you leave this toggle off, we will not serve any other scheme by default. In this scenario, you’ll need to add a toggle switch on the front end so users can manually switch back and forth. Note: ACSS detects the user’s preference on page load rather than loading extra CSS in a media query, so browser color scheme simulators will not work for previewing color schemes. Use the in-builder color scheme toggle, a front-end toggle, or your actual OS’ color scheme preference settings. Current Design​ If ACSS is going to serve an alternate color to users based on their preference, we need to know the main, non-alt scheme, for your website. This is set in the “Current Design” area, where you tell ACSS if your main design is primarily light or primarily dark. If your website is primary light and the user prefers light, we’ll serve the main scheme. If your website is opposite of what the user prefers, we’ll serve the alt scheme. Color Inversion & Adjustment​ Depending on the alternate scheme you’re trying to achieve, some colors and shades may need to be inverted, changed completely, or left alone. For this reason, ACSS doesn’t attempt to do anything by default (with the exception of the neutral palette). When you activate an alternate color, you’re essentially duplicating the default version of that color. You’re free to use the color picker to select a brand new color. Or, if you’re only wanting to invert the shades, you can simply starting inverting the lightness value for each shade. In the above example, we’re using a completely different color for the altnerate color and can easily adjust the saturation and lightness for all the shades using the “S” and “L” inputs. If you did want to invert the shades completely using the same color, just replace the lightness values with the inverse value. For example, “95” is five steps away from 100. So, the inverse value is five steps away from 0, or “5.” The inverse of “85” is “15.” And so on. In about six seconds, you can completely invert the shades. The Neutral/Shade Palette​ Another important aspect of color scheme is the handling of whites and blacks. Again, since “color scheme” can be used for more than dark/light, Automatic.css doesn’t manipulate black and white values without user input. The only time ACSS manipulates black and white values is if you turn on the alternate color for the Neutral palette. Since this is a palette of blacks and whites, we assume you’re using a true light/dark mode now and we invert black and white values automatically. If you want blacks and whites to be left alone, leave this toggle off. Note: Some people try to use raw values when they need black or white, such as , , or or keywords. These will never invert via color scheme. The only time white and black will invert is if you use the color variables and . Seeing Your Alternate Color Scheme in the Builder​ It’s tough to design an alternate scheme for a website if you can’t see what you’re doing. For this reason, Automatic.css adds a color scheme switch in the builder panel of every officially supported builder. This switch allows you to toggle back and forth between your main scheme and your alternate scheme inside the builder canvas. Seeing Your Alternate Color Scheme on the Front End​ If you activate “Prefers Color Scheme” in ACSS, users will automatically see the correct scheme when they visit the site (based on their preference). If you want to test this, you’ll need to change your operating system color scheme preference and then reload your site. Remember, you can’t use emulators because the CSS only checks the preference on page load. If you’re not using “Prefers Color Scheme,” you must provide the user with a front-end color scheme toggle. If you’re a Frames user, there’s a color scheme toggle component in the Frames dashboard under Components: Turn this component on and then add the switch element anywhere on your site using the builder interface. The switch can be used simultaneously with “Prefers Color Scheme.” We store the user’s preference in local storage and then serve them the scheme they last chose with the toggle (or serve the site based on their preference if they haven’t used the switch). If you’re not a Frames user, you have three options: Use our manual scheme switch for Bricks Builder Create your own switch however you’d like. Use this switch from our CodePen library. Manual & Programmatic Color Scheme Protection (Lock Selectors)​ When building a color-scheme-based website, it’s common to need to “protect” certain areas or elements from switching schemes. For example, if your site is primarily light, but there’s a dark section on the page, you want to protect that dark section from switching to light. For this reason, some frameworks have classes you can add to control what gets switched and what doesn’t. The problem with this method is that it’s manual and often lacks maintainability because you have to litter the color scheme protection classes everywhere. Automatic.css is the only framework we know of that offers programmatic & global color scheme protection. Rather than using utility classes on areas or elements you want to protect, you can protect them via their selector. In the Palette area, find the toggle that says “Lock Specific Selectors” and turn it on. An input will appear titled “Lock Selectors to Main Scheme.” This input accepts any valid selector including complex selectors, compound selectors, and combinators. Just make sure you wrap each selector in quotes and separate them by commas. Example: This example would protect the header, service cards, hero features images, and team grids from displaying the alt scheme. Tip: It’s typically best to use the block-level (parent) selector. This will automatically protect all children of the block and account for locally scoped variables that might be defined at the block level for children. This is, by far, the fastest and easiest way to control which areas of your site should switch between schemes or stay locked. Manual control still exists using and on any element respectively, but you’re usually better off doing this kind of thing programmatically from the dashboard.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageColor setup happens in the Palette tab of ACSS: Color Palette Panel Automatic.css provides the following customizable colors: Primary: The brand’s primary color (The main identifying brand color – also often the action color). Secondary: The brand’s second most used color. Tertiary: The brand’s third most used color. Accent: The brand’s least used color. Base: The brand’s base color (typically best if a dark version of the base is chosen) – most commonly used for backgrounds and text. Neutral: Black and white, plus shades of grey. This should cover the needs of 99% of websites, especially when you consider that these 6 colors are expanded into a palette of up to 36 options when you include the generated shades and over 200 options when you include transparencies. Shades​ When you enter your website’s color HEX codes, Automatic.css generates 1 contextual shade and 6 additional shades of each color ranging from ultra light to ultra dark: ultra-light light semi-light semi-dark dark ultra dark hover (reserved for hover use) Each shade is customizable via the Shades swatches next to the main swatch: Expanded Color Screen Shades are generated using HSL values. This is how most color systems generate shades. The Hue and Saturation values remain roughly the same, but the lightness value changes to create the desired shade. If you are trying to match shades to Hex values you were given by a designer, Google the HEX code and Google will tell you the HSL values for that color in their default color analyzer. You can then put those exact HSL values into ACSS for each shade. Opacities / Transparencies​ Transparent colors are very important in web design. They’re commonly used for backgrounds, overlays, borders, and more. ACSS optionally generates 10 transparencies of each main color, 10 transparencies of the light shade of each color, 10 transparencies of the dark shade of each color, and 10 transparencies of the ultra-dark shade of each color. These transparencies can be accessed via various classes and variables. For example, will create a primary colored overlay at 60% opacity. You can use a variable, such as to reference a transparency anywhere a color value is accepted. Transparencies always map to the exact shade values you enter, so they’re automatically up to date with the latest Palette settings. If you don’t need certain groups of transparencies for any color, you can deactivate them in the dashboard. Creating Additional Colors, Shades, and Transparencies​ The default ACSS Palette with all shades and transparencies will cover 99% of use cases. However, if you do find yourself in a situation where you need more colors, shades, or transparencies, you can easily create them yourself. Creating a new color variable (and partials for maximum flexibility):​ To create a new color, we recommend defining all the following at the root level for your new color: Here’s an example: Using your new color​ Since your new color is based on variables, you can make your own utility classes with it, reference it within custom classes, or even reference it at the ID level. If you want to create a utility class that uses your new color, you can do that easily. You just have to decide what you want the utility class to do. Here’s an example where we create a new background color utility class: If you were creating a card and wanted to use that new color as the background color for the card, it would look like this: Once you’ve created a new color variable you can reference it anywhere. And since you created the color partials along with it, you can even do extra custom stuff like this: That would set the background color of your card to your new color at 50% saturation and 150% lightness. We’re just using a calc function to cut the value in half and multiply the value. When you have the right variables at your disposal, there are zero limitations in what you can accomplish. Note: These same color partials are available for all colors in the ACSS system, so you can use this exact technique with the existing colors. Creating a new shade variable​ To create a new shade, you’ll want to reference the HSL values for your new color (or an existing color), but change the shades to the new desired values: In the above example, we’re referencing the and value from our new custom color, but then replacing the value with a new static value (higher values are lighter and lower are darker). You can do this as many times as you’d like to create as many shades as you’d like. Then you’re free to assign these shades to utility classes or reference them in custom classes. Creating a new transparency variable​ To create a new transparency, you’ll want to reference the HSL values for your new color (or an existing color), but add the alpha value for the transparency to the HSL string. In this case, you usually don’t need to reference the HSL values individually. That’s where our HSL variable comes in handy: In the above example, we’re referencing the full HSL string for our new custom color, but then adding a “/” and the alpha value (opacity). This is one way to write an HSL string. Any validly structured HSL string will work. You can do this as many times as you’d like to create as many transparencies as you’d like and then you’re free to use them with utility classes or custom classes. Contextual Colors​ Aside from these main brand colors, ACSS also allows you to configure contextual colors and contextual color utilities. Learn more about contextual colors.

Below is an example of a simple bulleted list broken into columns: This is a list item. This is a list item. This is a list item. This is a list item. This is a list item. This is a list item. There are two advantages to columns over Flexbox and Grid: Content will flow automatically from column to column. You can easily separate columns with ruled dividers. The downsides of columns: There’s no support for , so you need to do some trickery to add a bottom margin to all direct children. They don’t work on Flex containers, so you lose the ability to order items with CSS. You can’t place items like you can with CSS Grid. Columns are used in specific situations. Most commonly: Breaking long text into columns. Breaking lists in columns. Creating masonry layouts. Automatic.css offers utility classes to help you quickly achieve various column layouts and styles. Column Functionality in ACSS​ You can turn Columns support on or off in the ACSS dashboard under “Options.” This will enable or disable all Columns utilities. Column Count & Column Width​ There are three ways you can approach creating columns: Define a specific column count at each breakpoint. Define a minimum column width. Define a specific column count and a minimum column width. Let’s take a look at each option: Note: Column utilities in ACSS will automatically set an element to . This is because columns don’t work with display flex or display grid. Defining a specific column count at each breakpoint​ As is true with grid classes, you can define a specific column count at each breakpoint using classes and you can change the column count at a specific breakpoint with . You can declare column counts from 1 to 5 at any breakpoint level. Defining a minimum column width (automatically responsive)​ Defining a column number isn’t required with CSS columns. If you define a column width instead of a count, you’re effectively telling the browser to render as many or as few columns as possible based on the column width. This column width acts as a minimum width. Columns can be wider, but they can’t be smaller than the declared width. If a column can’t be its minimum width, it’ll stack automatically. Use the classes to set a minimum column width. Your options are: You can configure the exact sizes of these three utilities in the ACSS dashboard. If you’re creating a custom element with BEM classes and want to use columns, you can reference your column widths using variables as well: Defining a specific column count & minimum column width (automatically responsive)​ If you want to declare a specific number of columns on desktop, but still want the columns to stack automatically, you can declare the desired number of columns and a minimum column width. Example: Remember, since you defined a specific number of columns, the space between columns will be determined by the width of the parent container. If there’s too much space between columns, change the width of the parent container. Gap​ Columns support column gap natively, but not row gap. Since this is Automatic.css and we know you want row gap supported, we’ve built in the required functionality (as of v2.8). Here’s how it works: If you want column-gap only or different gap values for columns and rows​ Column gap can be set with or utilities. If you want row-gap only or different gap values for columns and rows (v2.8+)​ Row gap can be set with or utilities. Using the shorthand utilities will still set both row and column to the same value. If you want column-gap and row-gap to be the same (v2.8+)​ Symmetrical gaps can be set with standard utilities. This will only work in combination with or utilities. Column Rule Width, Style, and Color​ A unique feature of Columns is the ability to define ruled columns. This is a visual divider between columns that can have a style, width, and color. Set a style first​ Think of a column rule like a border. If a style isn’t set, the border won’t show up. So, the first thing you need to do is set a style with classes. The following styles are available: dotted dashed solid double groove ridge inset outset Column rule width​ You can change the width of the rule style with .col-rule-[size] utilities: Additionally, you can reference these values with variables: The exact values for these utilities can be configured in the ACSS dashboard. Column rule color​ Finally, you can set the color of the ruler using utilities. All active colors and shades are available. Column Span​ Columns have one last trick up their sleeve. While they don’t support spans and starts the way Grid does, they do have the ability to “span all.” This can be set on any direct child element of the Columns container (e.g. a , , , etc.) To make an element span all columns, you can use the same utility class from Flex and Grid: .",

This means that even if the parent container or viewport size changes, the browser will adjust the element’s dimensions to maintain the specified width-to-height ratio.

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageBoxed layouts are an interesting alternative to the edge-to-edge layouts of many websites. While you don’t see them as often anymore, they’re bound to make a comeback in the future and they’re certainly not looked down upon when executed correctly. You can see an example of a boxed layout in the photo below. Boxed Layout Example There are three ingredients to making a boxed layout: The element of the website extends edge to edge and defines a “canvas” color or texture. In the example above, this is the black area. The element of the website is set to a fixed width and is the true “background” and visual “container” of the website. This is where you see the 1px orange border in the example above. A content width is still defined at the container level to maintain proper content alignment within the overall structure and there’s still a gutter, the same as with any other website. Automatic.css makes establishing a boxed layout, and styling your boxed layout, very easy. Boxed Layout Settings​ Boxed Layout Settings Navigate to Layout > Boxed Layout and enable the Boxed Layout toggle. The following settings control your boxed layout. Read carefully because the accepted values aren’t completely obvious unless you’re a pro at CSS. Device Background: The canvas style behind your boxed layout, which extends edge-to-edge. This is a background shorthand property and accepts any valid background value including colors, gradients, and images. Body Width: The visual width of the contained boxed layout. Keep in mind that visitors will only see a boxed layout effect on devices larger than this width. Top Margin: The space between your boxed layout and the top of the screen. This will effectively bump your site’s positioning in the canvas down from the top of the screen by the amount specified. Note: Due to the way web design works, a bottom margin is not possible on boxed layouts without completely changing the website’s structure. Border Style: You can optionally add a border to your boxed layout. This field accepts multiple values, allowing you to style each side independently. It uses the normal top, right, bottom, left value syntax. Border Width: Control the thickness of your border. Again, multiple values are possible. It uses the normal top, right, bottom, left value syntax. Border Color: Control the color of your border. Again, multiple values are possible. It uses the normal top, right, bottom, left value syntax. Border Radius: Control the radius of your boxed layout. Body Shadow: This is a box shadow added to the element that creates a drop shadow effect behind your boxed layout. Accepts any valid value including layered shadows. When done well, boxed layouts can add visual interest and a sense of simplicity to your website. They also prevent many visual issues and alignment/layout issues that happen on very large screens since your content is effectively contained.",

Rather, they’ll maintain 100% width because there’s no longer anything to break out of. “Full” will always extend edge to edge, though, even on mobile. Note: “Full” breakouts can cause a horizontal scrollbar to appear in certain browsers. This is due to the browser misinterpreting the need for a scrollbar on 100vw width elements (because the element goes behind the scrollbar area of the browser, the browser believes it needs to add a horizontal scrollbar.

The content width of your website is an important value. You’ll commonly want to set elements to the website’s content width, or to a value that’s somehow relative to the website’s content width. You can easily do this in Automatic.css with two utilities: and . Setting Your Website’s Content Width​ Your website’s content width is set in the ACSS Viewport tab. The second value is the most important value. It’s the width of your content on desktop devices. This is the value that is referenced by the utilities. Once you’ve set your website’s content width, you need to inform your page builder of this value. The best way of doing this is with var(–content-width). You don’t want to tell the page builder the same static value because this creates a potential disconnect should your content width ever change. If you set your content width in ACSS and then reference that value everywhere else with variables, you’re free to make changes to this value without anything breaking. The Content Width Utility Class​ Any time you need to set an element’s width to your website’s content width, you can use the variable. This variable actually sets the element’s max-width instead of its literal width to ensure it’s still responsive. The Content Width Variable​ I already mentioned that you can use var(–content-width) in your page builder’s global theme styles, but you can do a lot more with this variable. Any time you need a custom element (an element with a BEM class) to be content width, it’s best to use the variable instead of the utility class. Set the element’s to 100% and then use the variable with the property. Another everyday use is within calculations. Let’s say I want an elemeent to be 75% of the content width. I can easily do this: You might say, “why not just make the element 75% of the container?” While that would work on desktop, it wouldn’t have the same effect on mobile. On mobile, it’ll always remain 75% wide, which is often undesirable. Using the content-width variable gets you 75% on desktop and 100% on mobile because the max-width variable is referencing a fixed value rather than a percentage. In essence, the variable is automatically responsive while the percentage value causes complications on mobile devices.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageYou probably already know about the Content Width utilities in ACSS, but do you know about Content Width Safe? This utility references your website’s content width while simultaneously creating a gutter on smaller screens. It’s extremely handy! What’s a gutter?​ A gutter is the inline padding that protects your content from touching the edge of the screen on smaller devices. On advanced websites (and ACSS websites), the gutter is responsive. The larger the screen, the larger the gutter is (up to desktop, where the gutter no longer matters because the screen is much wider than the website’s content width). Even though it’s responsive, it should be a referenceable value. Every section of your site should reference the gutter value to ensure that your gutter is equal throughout the site. A gutter that changes from section to section or element to element is a clear sign of amateur web design. ACSS references the website’s gutter with . This is because gutters are typically defined within the element throughout a website, and the gutter is represented across the X-axis. What if there’s no gutter and I need a gutter?​ There are two primary situations that you might find yourself in when it comes to needing a gutter and not having one: You’re working in a where the inline padding is set to “0.” You’re not working in a at all, thus there’s no gutter. In the first case, since you’re working in a section, a container will define your website’s content width for you. The problem is, the content will touch the edges of the screen on smaller devices. This is probably not desirable. In the second case, you’re without a section, so you’re without a content-width container by default, and without a gutter as well. The standard Content Width utilities won’t help you here. While you can set something to content width, it’s still not going to have a gutter. What you need is a utility that references your website’s content width while simultaneously, somehow, creating a gutter. That’s exactly what and do. Set’s the element’s to content width. Uses an intelligent function to establish a virtual gutter that’s equal to your website’s typical gutter. Automatically centers your content (just like a typical section container does). The variable does the first two of those, but you’ll need to do the third thing on your own. Here’s how it would look with CSS: Notice once again that we’re using the variable with the property. We want to avoid setting explicit widths for maximum responsiveness. When should I use content-width vs content-width–safe?​ Good question! It’s certainly not either-or. It’s not preference. These are tools designed for specific situations, so it’s important to know the situation you’re in. If you need to make an element equal to your website’s content width, and you’re working within a parent element that has a physical gutter, just use the Content Width utilities. If you need to make an element equal to your website’s content width, and you’re working within a parent element without a physical gutter, use the Content Width Safe utilities. Caution: Double Gutter​ Make sure you don’t use the Content Width Safe utilities in a parent element that already establishes a gutter. This will result in a double gutter.",

For example, let’s say your header is sticky and you’re using a sticky element on your page. You need a top value on your sticky element that references your website’s header height. Automatic.css creates a variable automatically. You just have to tell ACSS what the height of your header is. Once ACSS has this information, it can automatically create super helpful content offsets, sticky offsets, scroll offsets, etc. First, let’s talk about how to set your header heights. Then we’ll run through all the things ACSS can help you with when it comes to your header height. Header Height Values​ Header Heights In the ACSS dashboard, navigate to Layout and then Header. ACSS needs to know the height of your header at each breakpoint. This is easy to find by loading your site on the front end, right clicking your header, and getting the computed height. Do this at each breakpoint and insert the value into the inputs. Note: If your header height ever changes, recalculate these values. Offset Page Content Automatically​ Offset Content Automatically Option If your website uses a sticky header, it means that your header takes up some of the room in the hero section of your pages. This makes your hero spacing look off-balance. In this case, turn on the “Offset Page Content Automatically” option. Automatic.css will now fix every page on your website automatically, restoring perfectly balanced spacing to the first section on every page. Exclude Headers & Pages From Content Offset​ In some cases, you might want to remove the offset on certain pages or when certain headers are present. This is possible using the exclusion options that activate when you turn on Offset Content Automatically. Exclude Headers & Exclude Pages for Offset Content Automatically Option You can exclude specific headers by entering any valid selector for the header. A data attribute is a really good way to do this because it also allows you to make a header sticky or not sticky from the back-end of WordPress. We provide a default data attribute that you can use, which is already excluded by default. Of course, you can use any selector or list of selectors you’d like, just make sure to wrap each selector in quotes and comma separate them. You can also disable the offset on specific pages by referencing the unique body class of the page (WordPress adds a body class to every page automatically) or by using the default utility class . Sticky Offset​ The same issue with scroll-to-hash happens with sticky elements. By default sticky elements stick to the top of the screen. A sticky header will cover them up if you don’t give the sticky element an offset value. If you want Automatic.css to automatically rescue your sticky elements and offset them, turn on the “Offset Sticky Elements Automatically” setting in the Sticky Styling panel (Additional Styling): Offset Sticky Automatically Option Now, when you use the class, you don’t have to worry about an offset. ACSS will use your header height and your offset preferences from above to generate the appropriate offset. Of course, this can be overridden on a case-by-case basis by setting a custom top value for any sticky element.",

Or, they force it back to its original aspect ratio within the new container bounds (). Note: “Contain” is similar to the technique of letterboxing in video production. It’s used far less often than “cover.” As is true with background images, you can also choose which area of the image to preserve () with “area” being one of the following named coordinates: top-left top-center top-right center-left center-right bottom-left bottom-center bottom-right Note: There’s no center-center option because that’s the default position of object-fit. Here’s an example of how and when to use object-fit classes: In the above example changes the aspect ratio of the image to 16×9. The image had an original aspect ratio of 6×4, thus we need to use object-fit to prevent improper stretching.

Ribbons are commonly used to visually mark specific types of elements, like cards, with additional information. For example, an “On sale” ribbon can mark e-commerce items as currently on sale. Adding Your First Ribbon​ It’s easy to add a ribbon to any container. Set and on the container you want to add the ribbon to (this won’t be necessary once Firefox supports . Add a text element to the container. This will be the text of your ribbon. Add the class to your text element to activate the ribbon functionality. Add a ribbon position class (e.g. or ) to your text element to position the ribbon. That’s it! You’ve added your first ribbon. Customizing Your Ribbon​ You can customize ribbon styles three ways: Globally Contextually Individually Customization is done via the following locally scoped variables: For reference, the default values for these are as follows: Offset: -2rem Width: 30rem Padding: .5em 1em Background Color: var(–action) Text Color: var(–white) Text Size: var(–text-s) Shadow: 0 5px 10px var(–shade-trans-10); To style a ribbon contextually, create a custom modifier class to identify it and then set its styling via locally scoped variables. You only need to add the variables you want to change. So if you like all the default ribbon styling but want to change the background color, text color, and shadow, you only need to alter those three variables: When adding your new “sale” ribbon, you’ll want to add the standard class and your new class. This is the standard for how modifier classes work. One class adds base styling, and the modifier modifies the style. Dynamic Ribbons​ Sometimes you need Ribbons that are added, styled, and positioned based on dynamic data. This is easily doable with ACSS ribbons. To get started, add your text element along with the base class. Instead of using static text, insert dynamic data from a custom field. To position the ribbon, use our preconfigured data attribute. Add to your element and then use one of the positioning values: top-right top-left You can use your own custom data attribute to dynamically style the ribbon based on custom field values or some other parameter. Follow the same process that you would follow when creating a custom ribbon class. Here’s an example of our “on sale” ribbon styled using data attributes: You can create as many ribbon styles as you want and then trigger which one gets used by dynamically passing the style name to the data attribute value.",

Some users prefer unbalanced grid items to be centered at the bottom of the grid, like this: The only programmatic solution is to use Flexbox. But, Flexbox isn’t designed to create grid layouts, so a lot of math is involved to get it right, especially when you want to use gap to space items out. This is where Automatic.css “Flex Grid” comes in. Flex Grid is a feature unique to Automatic.css that allows users to create grid layouts where unbalanced items can be centered or stretched. All the complicated math and setup is done for you. You can even adjust the gap size without issue. How to use Flex Grid classes​ Flex grid classes work exactly like our regular grid classes. Make sure Flex Grid is turned on in ACSS options. Add the desired desktop Flex Grid count class to the parent container (e.g. ) Change the column count at the desired breakpoints using breakpoint classes (e.g. ) Adjust the gap using classes or classes. Just add to the parent container and you’re all set. Your unbalanced items will be centered at the bottom of the grid by default. The only difference is that Flex Grid only supports up to six columns, whereas our regular Grid system supports up to 12 columns. Stretching unbalanced items​ If you want the unbalanced items to stretch along the inline axis to fill up all the space in the grid, the children of the grid need to be instructed to grow to fill the available space. You can do this with the class (applied to the grid container, not the child). Are there variables for Flex Grid?​ Creating variables for Flex Grid isn’t possible. This is because Flex Grid isn’t established with a single value like Grid. Instead, it’s a collection of instructions, and collections of instructions can’t be assigned to a single variable.

To get started, make sure Load Forms is turned on in the Forms screen of the ACSS dashboard: Load Forms Setting Once activated, you’ll see three tabs and multiple settings panels. Form Styling is divided into three areas: Default – All global form styles that are shared between both color styles. This covers things like spacing, font size, gaps, and more. Light Styles – All styles associated with a “light” form. Dark Styles – All styles associated with a “dark” form. If you don’t care to use either the dark or light style set, you can simply ignore that particular tab. The Premise of Form Styling​ Most projects don’t have multiple different form styles. As with most things, consistency is the goal. Therefore, all the forms on your site should share certain structural and spacing values. In ACSS, this is done in the Default tab. Beyond that, you want to be able to customize the colors and look and feel of your forms. The only time form styles need to differ a lot is when you need a dark form versus a light form. Thus, we have a style set for each. Keep in mind that this is not related to color scheme. The light and dark form styles can be deployed on your website regardless of color scheme settings. Styling Forms (Form Utility Classes)​ ACSS will not style your form unless one of the utility classes is present. Your options are and . Once you’ve placed the utility class directly on the form element in the builder, you’ll see the styles change to ACSS’ defaults. You can then configure your styles very easily using live preview. Supported Forms​ The ACSS Light and dark form classes are currently compatible with the following form plugins WS Form Fluent Forms Bricks Additional form plugins will also be supported in the near future. Important Note about WS Form​ With version 1.10.x, WS Form introduced the new Styler system, offering greater control over WordPress form design. However, this update has impacted the functionality of our form utility classes. Therefore, we currently recommend disabling the Styler until we have fully refactored our form framework. When the Styler is disabled, our form utility classes work without any issues. Disabling the Styler​ To disable the Styler and revert to the legacy Customize method, add the following PHP code to your theme’s file (preferably in a child theme) or as a code snippet: After making this change, navigate to WS Form > Settings and click Save to regenerate the legacy CSS files.",

The other approaches would be good if you find yourself repeating the same over and over again. Colors​ You can calc() colors to manipulate existing colors or create news. For example, let’s say I wanted to reduce the saturation of my primary color by 20% and assign that to a new custom property. I can do this: Here’s a breakdown: – Declare a new HSL value. – Reference the primary color’s hue value. – Reference the primary color’s saturation value and reduce it by 20% using . – Reference the primary color’s lightness value.

ACSS users can generate custom clamp functions on the fly without the need for a third-party clamp generator. allows you to define the minimum and the maximum pixel values while automatically calculating the middle value for you based on your website’s content width and root font size. Since this is a SCSS function, it can only be used in the custom SCSS area of the ACSS dashboard or ACSS dashboard input fields. However, you can assign the value of the function to a custom property that can then be used anywhere. Example: Creating a Custom Property​ Let’s say you want to define a new custom font size like . Open the custom SCSS area of ACSS and do this: Define your new custom property within and set the value to the function. Since you’re in , you must interpolate the function with . You can do the same thing for custom spacing variables or anything that requires a custom function. Example: Creating a Custom Utility Class​ If you just want to use the fluid() function within a new utility class, you can do so without interpolation because functions work out of the box when you’re using them outside of . Here’s an example of how to make a custom gap utility class: You just have to figure out whether this is truly the best approach for your use case. If you made a new variable called using the process outlined in section one, you could then use that new custom property for many things: gap, padding, margin, etc. It’s a good idea to avoid repeating the same function over and over again.

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageIt’s sometimes necessary to deprecate features and utilities in a CSS Framework. This is usually due to the following factors: Advancements in CSS make a feature/utility irrelevant or redundant. Improved methodologies are developed and replace previous methodologies. The removal of inconsistencies that weren’t initially identified. While deprecation can sometimes be inconvenient, it’s necessary and beneficial. Please note that our deprecation policy is very straightforward: Deprecated features are retained in the framework and can activated or deactivated at any time. They’re never removed completely. Deprecated features are never turned off on existing installs. If a feature is turned on prior to upgrading to a version where that feature is deprecated, the feature will remain on after upgrade. Frames and ACSS defaults never use deprecated features or utilities. They are replaced as soon as possible with current standards. If you find a Frame or default value using a deprecated item, please report it as a bug. If a deprecated feature is turned off on upgrade after previously being on, this is not by design and should be reported to the team as a bug. Here is the full list of deprecated features since the inception of ACSS in 2021: Text Larger​ was a utility class originally created as a way to provide “tweener” sizes for text. You could combine it with a standard text size class to create a slightly larger version. This utility was eventually made redundant by the widespread support of variables and expressions in page builders, SCSS support, easy access to global CSS, etc. When you can calc a variable or manually make a new utility from an existing utility, a class like not only becomes redundant, but inefficient and undesirable. Owl Spacing​ Owl Spacing () was a spacing technique based on the “Lobotomized Owl” CSS selector () that adds top margin to all adjacent siblings. It’s essentially a poor man’s gap technique which was extremely useful prior to widespread support of the gap property. This set of utilities was deprecated to give preference to the gap property when gap reached 92%+ support for flex layouts. Not only is gap easier and cleaner, it’s more performant as it doesn’t require the use of universal selectors. Abbreviated Padding Classes​ ACSS’ padding classes were originally abbreviated: In 2022 we decided to establish an anti-abbreviation policy. Abbreviations introduce confusion, create extra memorization requirements, and make it harder to guess utility names. The abbreviated utilites were replaced with: Deprecated Colors​ Shade: Shade was a poor name for a main color that created confusion with the shade options of each color. It was deprecated and replaced with “Neutral” for better clarity. Action: Action was designed to be the obvious choice for action items (buttons and links). Unfortunately, it’s not a widely used color in standard design systems. During the development of ACSS 3.0 we decided to standardize the ACSS color system and bring it in better alignment with industry norms. With Action deprecated, Primary is now the typical color choice for buttons and links. Deprecated Shades​ Medium: The “medium” shade was contextually problematic because it lacked a meaningful name and was seemingly redundant with the main color value itself. What’s between ultra-dark, dark, light, and ultra-light? The main color. And medium? This was deprecated for a more sensical approach of ultra-dark, dark, semi-dark, main color, semi-light, light, ultra-light. Comp: A “complimentary” shade of each color was introduced in the original framework. The plan was to potentially expand on the generation of complimentary colors, but it was determined that this expansion was going to be unnecessary for the vast majority of users. Comp was deprecated in v3.0 due to low use and user confusion. Deprecated Buttons​ Shade: Deprecated with the deprecation of the Shade color. Action: Deprecated with the deprecation of the Action color. White & Black: White and Black buttons seem very useful and straightforward, but on sites where a neutral button needs to not be black or white, it’s problematic. We introduced a Neutral button with light and dark options to replace Black and White. Neutral-light allows you to have a white button or a light neutral button. Neutral-dark allows you to have a black button or a dark neutral button. And you can do whatever you want with the standard Neutral button.",

    ],
    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageUsing a utility class is relatively simple and straightforward, but there are two pre-requisites: You have to know what utility classes are available to you based on what you’re trying to accomplish. You have to apply the proper utility classes to the proper elements or you’ll get unintended results. Applying Utility Classes Directly to Elements In many cases, you’ll be applying a utility class directly to an element. For example, to add padding to a div, you simply add a padding class directly to the div. .pad–m would give you medium padding inside the div. If you want to change the padding on the div, you’d remove the .pad–m class and use a different padding class. .pad–l would give you larger padding and .pad–s would give you smaller padding. Applying Utility Classes to a Parent Container​ Sometimes, you can – or need to – add the utility classes to a parent container. For example, the .grid– classes get applied to a div or a section in order to position the child elements in the grid. Another example would be .text– classes such as .text–white. When applied to a parent container, all text in that container will become white. You don’t have to put the .text–white class on every single item of text inside the container individually. Using Utility Classes as Overrides​ You can use utility classes to override other styles. For example, if you want an H2 to be smaller, you can apply text size classes such as .text–l or .text–m to change its size. .text–l _makes an H2 smaller because the H2 size in the hierarchy corresponds with the “XL” size. H1 is the “XXL” size. “L” is obviously smaller than both of those._While there’s a little bit of a learning curve, it only takes a few days of practice before you’re blazing through site creation using utility classes. Stacking Utility Classes​ You often need to use more than one utility class to accomplish your design goals as utility classes are very specific by design. Because of the way classes work in CSS, you can easily stack multiple classes onto the same element. To create a card, for example, you would start with a div and then you’d add multiple utility classes to that same div to create the desired style. If you wanted to have a card with medium padding, medium border radius, a base background color and white text, you’d add all the following to the div: It doesn’t matter what order you add the classes in as they’re interchangeable. Situations to Avoid​ One thing you want to avoid doing is stacking classes that try to accomplish the same thing. For example, if you add to get medium padding but then decide you want large padding, you shouldn’t stack the class on the same element. Instead, you should add and then remove .. While having both classes typically won’t break anything because one will just override the other, it’s extremely inefficient and technically incorrect.",

Controlling the style and behavior of elements at the class level is safer and more powerful because it allows for global control over any element that has that class. Utility classes are “preset” classes that control specific aspects of an element’s styling or behavior.

    "content": "Version: 3.xOne of the “cons” of most CSS frameworks is that learning hundreds of utilities is time-consuming or impractical. Another “con” is having too many options for each utility. This is very true of frameworks that use abbreviated names, very granular utilities, and/or seemingly random values. Automatic.css does not have this problem. While there are tons of utilities in the framework, users only have to learn one primary convention/syntax for sizing. Once you know the sizing syntax, you automatically know what your options are across all sizing utilities without having to refer to documentation or cheat sheets. The syntax for sizing is what we call “t-shirt sizes.” Almost all non-contextual utilities that reference size values use the t-shirt sizing syntax with the options being: xs, s, m, l, xl, xxl. Here are some examples: This doesn’t just make the framework easier to learn, it makes it easier to use and encourages greater consistency. Having more options is positively correlated with more inconsistency across a site. In other words, the more options you have to choose from, the more inconsistent your website will be. Or, users have to waste additional time referencing which values they used previously to do the next task correctly. When you have fewer options, it’s easier and faster to use the same ones in the same situations. The use of contextual utilities like contextual spacing and contextual colors makes this even easier and faster. So, almost any time you’re using a utility that references a size, you’ll have the same t-shirt size options available to you. There’s nothing else to memorize or reference!",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageUtility classes are like “presets” that help you change the style or behavior of elements quickly without needing to write css or change styles manually in a builder. Example​ Let’s say you want to create a 3-column grid. In a builder like Oxygen, you have to do a lot of different things (and know how Grids work). And in CSS, you’d have to write a lot of lines of code. But with utility classes, you simply add the .grid–3 class to a div and it transforms it into a 3-column grid. What if you need to change your div to a 1-column grid at on mobile devices? That would require additional code or additional fiddling in the buidler. But with a utility system like Automatic.css, you simply add .grid–s-1 to your div and it automatically transforms your 3-column grid to 1-column at the “S” breakpoint. Benefits to Using Utility Classes​ They create extreme consistency. Padding, margin, headings, text sizes, colors, etc. always use the same values regardless of how many people are developing the site. They speed up workflow. Utility classes are much faster than writing css or fiddling in a builder. They can help you accomplish certain things that you may not be comfortable attempting in a more manual fashion. Take our grid example from above. With utility classes, you can easily create grids for your project even if you don’t know how grids work from a code perspective. They help you quickly test structure and design before you create custom classes. If you’re going to create a custom element, you might want to “mock it up” with utility classes so you know exactly what needs to happen. Then it’s easy to create the perfect custom class structure for your custom element. They’re already setup with fallbacks. If you want to use advanced techniques like clamp() and calc() on your own, you need to make sure there are fallbacks in place. With Automatic.css, you don’t have to worry about fallbacks because they’re already installed. And because of Automatic’s variable hooks, even if you create custom classes and elements you still have fallback protection.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageVariables, or “custom properties” in CSS, are the modern standard for assigning values. Variables make web development more efficient, consistent, and maintainable. ACSS was one of the first utility frameworks to encourage using variables while giving users an entire library of variables that perfectly map to utility classes. And really, ACSS variables are the most potent aspect of Automatic.css. How variables work​ A variable in CSS is just a token, or placeholder, for a value. Here’s a typical scenario where you need to set the background color of a card: That color isn’t random. It is a dark color commonly used across many parts of our example website, which means it’s referenced over and over again. Using the hex code is undesirable because: Hex codes are hard to remember. You’ll probably need to look it up whenever you use it. If the color changes in the future, you’ll have to change the hex code everywhere it was used manually. Hex codes can’t be changed dynamically based on certain conditions. Hex codes can’t be manipulated. For example, you can’t set alpha transparency, adjust its hue, adjust its saturation, or adjust its lightness. It’s better to use a variable here because a variable solves all these common challenges. is the variable, but it must be wrapped in a function to use it. At first, this takes a little getting used to, but the learning curve is relatively flat. After a few times, it’ll become second nature. How do variables get their values?​ Values are assigned to variables in one of two places: At the site’s level (global variables) At the element/class level (local variables) In Automatic.css, all variables are defined for you at the level making them available site-wide by default. They map to all of your chosen values in the ACSS dashboard. There are variables for colors, font sizes, border radius, spacing, and more. Open the cheat sheet and filter the utility type to “variable” to see all available variables. How & when to use a variable in ACSS​ Variables should be used when you create a custom class for an element. This is common in situations where you want to maintain global control over an element’s styling. Thus you don’t want to use utility classes. Here’s a great video that will help you understand when to use utility classes vs custom classes: Utility Classes vs Custom Classes in ACSS (Best Practices) - YouTube When using a custom class, it means you will assign values for different CSS properties manually. For example, we need to define padding for our example card above. We could very easily choose a random value for our spacing (e.g. 3em), but then we’d lose many benefits of the ACSS variable, namely consistency and automatic responsiveness. Overriding variables with local values​ A key benefit of using global variables is that you can change the variable’s value at any time and it’ll apply everywhere that variable has been used. There’s another benefit, though – the ability to override a variable’s value in specific places. Let’s say that “my-card” is being used in a specific place where we want to change its text color and background color. Here’s the code we have our card so far: All we need to do is give our tokens new values. We just have to do this within a specific context, like when there’s a specific data attribute present: This would change the value of to whatever the value of our color is. And it would change the text color from to whatever the value of is. You could also do this with a modifier class: You could also do it to a single card by applying this technique at the ID level: The point is that variables have additional superpowers where static values do not.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageIt’s important to understand that Automatic.css is ***NOT*** a “utility-first framework.” When a framework is “utility-first” it means that you’re supposed to use utility classes for pretty much everything. You’re not creating custom classes and you’re not writing any CSS. That’s the goal anyway. Automatic.css rejects a utility-first philosophy because a utility-first approach is not scalable or future proof in a page builder scenario. If you are custom coding a website, scalability and future proofing are less of an issue because you have more flexibility in how code can be duplicated, repeated, and component-ized. When using page builders, however, utility-first is a disaster. An Example of a Big Problem With Utility Classes…​ Let’s say you create product card with an image, heading, description, price, and a few other elements. It could take two dozen or more utility classes to create a single card if you’re purely using utility classes. Now, you duplicate that card 8 more times to create a product grid. And you use that same grid on 5 other pages of your site. What do you do when the card design needs to change? When you use utility classes exclusively, you lose global control over re-usable components. There’s no “source of truth” for the component’s styling. A General Rule of Thumb…​ If you’re creating something on a page that is going to be used again, either on that page or on other pages, then you shouldn’t use utility classes. Instead, you should create custom classes and you should create them using an organized naming convention. We recommend the BEM method: BEM 101: How to Make Web Design Organized & Scalable - YouTube Here’s a critical detail: With most utility frameworks, you’d need to abandon the framework at this point and just use completely custom styling. With Automatic.css, though, you don’t have to abandon the framework. Nor should you! This is exactly where ACSS variables come into play. By creating custom classes that leverage ACSS variables, you can create global components that are responsive and perfectly match the rest of your site’s styling. With ACSS, you get the best of both worlds: the consistency of a framework and the global control of custom classes!",

This is a typical layout technique on the modern web where text is placed in a column next to an image or other media, and then in the next row, the two items switch positions. This pattern repeats back and forth. Alternating Grid Example How to create an auto-alternating grid​ Create a container for all your two-column grid “rows.” Create your two-column layout using classes. You can use even grid like or any of the uneven grid classes, such as . Duplicate the “row” as many times as needed. Decide which breakpoint (and up) you want the grids to start alternating at (you typically don’t want them alternating their content on mobile devices. Add a class that matches the smallest breakpoint you want them to start alternating at. This is a “min-width” media query, so it will affect your grid at the chosen breakpoint and UP (not down). For example, will alternate your row content at the L breakpoint and up. Don’t forget to use the other media query classes to make your grid responsive.",

Additional Arguments​ The auto grid mixin has additional options, passed as arguments in the parenthesis. Here’s an explanation of each argument: – The number of initial grid columns – The minimum inline dimension of each item before stacking occurs (if you change this value, it could change the number of initial columns) – The column flow ( or ) – Determines whether equal columns are forced during the stacking context to eliminate the possibility of orphans. Only useful for grids with an initial even column count. Values are or . Passing Arguments​ You can pass arguments in any order as long as you call them by name.

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageAuto Grids are automatically responsive grids that don’t require the user to make any breakpoint decisions. Here are some benefits of Auto Grids in ACSS: Lightweight CSS No breakpoint decisions Can be reactive to the specific type of content in the grid by adjusting var(–min) Can be applied to a custom class with a mixin: @include auto-grid($col-count, $min-item-width); Can be applied to a custom class with a recipe: @auto-grid; Downsides of Auto Grids: Using column and row spans isn’t practical. Remember, none of the grid systems in ACSS are perfect for every scenario. We give you multiple different types of grid systems so you can choose the most appropriate system for each situation. Turning on Auto Grids​ Auto Grid can be turned on in the options panel under Utility Classes. Once activated, you’ll see an Auto Grid area in the Layout panel: Screenshot How to Apply Auto Grid With Classes​ Auto Grid has utility-class support for up to 12 columns as well as support for what we call “ratio grids.” Auto-Grid Stacking Aggressiveness​ Auto Grid Aggressiveness Setting By default, Auto Grids use a math formula to figure out when grid items should stack. This math formula has a user-adjustable control that we call “Aggressiveness.” This setting controls the default aggressiveness of *all* Auto Grids across the site. If you want items to have more sizing leeway prior to stacking, use a lower number. If you want items to have less sizing leeway and stack sooner, use a higher number. The acceptable value is a decimal from 0 to 1. Remember, this is only the default. You can control the exact stacking behavior of individual Auto Grids using the control… Minimum Item Width​ Auto Grids work by setting a minimum item width on the items in the grid. As the device size gets narrower, the Auto Grid responds by moving items to new rows once they reach their minimum allowed width. You don’t have to set a minimum width value since one is already set for you. But, a great feature of auto grids is that you can control this minimum width value if desired, which means you can make the responsiveness of the grid perfectly match the requirements of the content inside it. Let’s say you have a testimonial card and you want to put a lot of them in a 3-column grid. Based on the design of the card, it starts looking too squished if its width goes below 280px. Start by applying to the parent container of the cards to establish the 3-column Auto Grid. Now, for this particular grid, go to the ID level and add some custom CSS: Now your auto grid will start stacking your testimonial cards as soon as they hit 280px in width. Instead of having to worry about breakpoints, which are disconnected from your content, Auto Grid makes responsiveness content-based. Note: Due to variable encapsulation, this variable will not be honored if you apply the grid with a variable (see below). How to Apply Auto Grid With Variables​ Auto grids (1-12) can be applied with variables as well. This lets you use Auto Grid with custom BEM classes. Set a box to display grid and then use one of the Auto Grid variables in the grid-template-columns property: Note: Due to variable encapsulation, this is the most limited way to use auto grids. You should only use this method if you’re okay with the default stacking behavior of the Auto Grid. If more control is needed, use the auto grid mixin or the auto grid recipe. How to Apply Auto Grid With a Mixin​ If you need to apply Auto Grid to a custom selector, you can easily do this with the auto grid mixin via the “Custom SCSS” area of the ACSS dashboard. How to Apply Auto Grid With a Recipe​ Auto Grid is also compatible with our recipes feature. This allows you to apply Auto Grid to a custom class using vanilla CSS. Select the element you want to turn into an auto grid, add a custom class, and then go to the custom CSS area of the style panel. You can trigger the Auto Grid recipe by typing The column count and minimum item width are both editable in the recipe. Auto Ratio Grids​ Ratio Grids are grids with uneven columns. The following ratios are available for Auto Ratio Grids: These are not true Auto Grids in the sense that they don’t use the exact same logic as Auto Grids. They are, however, automatically responsive. Auto Ratio Grids use a traditional grid structure to create the desired ratio, and then automatically stack at a specific breakpoint. The default stacking breakpoint is the “L” breakpoint, but you can change this if needed in the Layout panel by editing the “Ratio Breakpoint” field. Screenshot Forcing Even Columns and Eliminating Orphans​ 3.2.10 Users have the option of forcing even columns to eliminate orphans during column stacking. This will force all auto grids with an even number of initial columns to remain with even columns down to the “Initial Breakpoint (EC)” value set in the same area of the dashboard. The Initial Breakpoint value is a min-width media query that forces even columns at the chosen breakpoint and up. By default, this is set to the “S” breakpoint, meaning even columns will be forced at all breakpoints above S. A breakpoint has to be declared here because “1” is an odd number. We have to know where to allow for a single column, otherwise this setting would for all even grids to have a minimum of two columns. Even Columns & “Any” Columns with Utility Classes​ 3.2.10 “Force Even Columns” is a global setting that affects all auto grids. You can still force individual auto grids to have even columns without turning this on by using the utility class. The reverse is true as well. If you turn on the global option, but need to disable it on a specific grid, you can use . Additionally, you can override the breakpoint these behaviors occur at using breakpoint classes that follow the syntax: . It’s important to note that the “stack-even” classes are mobile-first (min-width) while the “stack-any” are traditional breakpoint classes (max-width). This means “stack-even” affects the chosen breakpoint and up while “stack-any” affects the chosen breakpoint and down. Controlling the Column Flow​ 3.2.10 The technique used for auto grids accepts two CSS keywords: and . By default, auto grids use . This means that if you have less items than the specified initial column count, the items will stretch to fill the available space. This is useful in many cases, but not all cases. In some cases you may want the items in your grid to be assigned to their actual cell, leaving the empty cells empty and the space reserved for them. If this is the case, you need to set the flow to . You can change the flow globally in the dashboard or per grid instance using a utility class. To set the option globally, choose in the dashboard: To set the option manually, use . Consequently, if you have chosen as the global default, you can change any grid back to with .",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageContent Grid presents a new paradigm for content layouts. Using advanced CSS Grid techniques, Automatic.css offers users a powerful way to vertically layout content using “zones.” Establishing a Content Grid Manually​ A Content Grid can be established in any box. You can even nest Content Grids inside other content grids. Simply add to any box and you’ve established a Content Grid or use the Content Grid Mixin or Content Grid Recipe. Note: When establishing a Content Grid in a element, ACSS will remove the section’s inline padding (gutter) and set any column gaps to zero. This is because the content grid establishes a gutter by default using your site’s global gutter value. Establishing a Content Grid Automatically (Sections)​ As of v3.0, ACSS allows you to convert all your top-level sections to Content Grid by default. Navigate to Layout > Content Grid and activate the setting “Default Sections to Content Grid.” If you need to turn off Content Grid on an individual section, you can use the class . Your Content Grid​ By default, your Content Grid will establish four content zones: Content Feature Feature Max Full Content Zone​ The Content Zone is the main content channel, centered within your Content Grid just like a centers content using an inner wrapper. The default width of the content zone is your website’s content width: . All content or boxes placed inside the Content Grid will be placed in the Content Zone by default. You can override this at any time by declaring a new content width on the box you’ve placed the utility class on, like this: Doing this at the ID level is okay since you only want to affect this individual content grid. “Feature” Zone​ There are two ways to get content to grow to fill the first Feature Zone. You can use a utility class (for individual items) or a grid-column instruction (for programmatic control). Method #1 (Single): Place the class on any element or box inside your Content Grid to instruct it to fill the Feature zone. Method #2 (Programmatic): You can tell specific types of items or groups of items to fill the Feature Zone automatically by setting their property to “.” The above example instructs all that are direct children of (the Content Grid in this case) to fill the Feature Zone. Changing the width of the Feature Zone​ You can change the value of the Feature Zone both globally and locally. The global value is set in the ACSS dashboard under Layout > Content Grid: You can also change the value of the Feature Zone locally on any individual Content Grid by setting to a new value: Note: The width value for the zone is added to whatever your current Content Zone is and it represents the value for each side of the zone. If your Content Zone is 1280px and you set the feature zone to “50px”, the zone will extend 50px on each side of the Content Zone for a total zone width of 1380px (1280px + (50px * 2)). “Feature Max” Zone​ The Feature Max Zone is a second, wider option. There are two ways to get content to grow to fill the Feature Max Zone. You can use a utility class (for individual items) or a grid-column instruction (for programmatic control). Method #1 (Single): Place the class on any element or box inside your Content Grid to instruct it to fill the Feature Max zone. Method #2 (Programmatic): You can tell specific types of items or groups of items to fill the Feature Max Zone automatically by setting their property to “.” The above example instructs all that are direct children of (the Content Grid in this case) to fill the Feature Max Zone. Changing the width of the Feature Max Zone​ You can change the value of the Feature Max Zone both globally and locally. The global value is set in the ACSS dashboard under Layout > Content Grid: You can also change the value of the Feature Max Zone locally on any individual Content Grid by setting to a new value: Note: The width value for the zone is added to whatever your current Content Zone is and it represents the value for each side of the zone. If your Content Zone is 1280px and you set the feature zone to “50px”, the zone will extend 50px on each side of your Content Zone, for a total feature zone width of 1380px (1280px + (50px * 2)). “Full” Zone​ The Full Zone is a literal full-width zone. Content assigned to the Full Zone will touch the edges of the screen. There are two ways to get content to grow to fill the Full Zone. You can use a utility class (for individual items) or a grid-column instruction (for programmatic control). Method #1 (Single): Place the class on any element or box inside your Content Grid to instruct it to fill the Feature Max zone. Method #2 (Programmatic): You can tell specific types of items or groups of items to fill the Feature Max Zone automatically by setting their property to “.” The above example instructs all that are direct children of (the Content Grid in this case) to span full width. “Full Width Safe”​ One final option exists: “Full Width Safe.” Let’s say you want to span a box to touch the edges of the screen, but you want content inside that box to respect your website’s gutter. You can do this by using the utility class. Additionally, you can do this programmatically by targeting a custom class and setting the to and to . Content Grid Responsiveness​ Content Grid layouts are automatically responsive. They will not cause overflow and they will respect your website’s gutter without any breakpoint management. Perfect 50/50 Split Layout​ You can achieve perfect 50/50 content splits with Content Grid, but it requires a little bit of math. First, set the inner container/block to display grid. Then, set the to this: Essentially, since the left-side content starts at the beginning of the content-width zone, we need the first grid cell to be exactly 50% of the content-width or 50% of the viewport minus the gutter, whichever is less. The other side of the grid (media wrapper) is just allowed to be , which will take up all remaining space. Next, we need to take away half of whatever the gap of the grid is. Thankfully, ACSS already uses a utility, so we can just reference that. If you ever want your gap to be a different value, don’t switch away from . Instead, assign a new value to on the inner container and you’re good to go without having to fix your statement.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageCSS Grid is a powerful layout method that allows us to create complex and responsive website layouts quickly and easily. Using standard grid classes in ACSS, we can use CSS Grid’s flexibility and efficiency without writing CSS manually, making it much easier to create intricate layouts quickly and easily. Grid classes are applied to a parent container to arrange its children. This is typically a container or a div inside a section. The video below shows how to get started with Responsive Grids with ACSS. Note: Some classes, like alignment, have slightly changed, but you can find all current classes in the ACSS cheat sheet. How to Easily Create Responsive Grids With Automatic.css - YouTube There are various ways we can apply standard grid classes to our design. BEM Classes with ACSS variables. By creating custom classes that leverage ACSS variables, we can create global grids that are responsive and controlled globally. Utility Classes with variables. We would apply utility classes to the container for one-off grids, but the best practice is adding a custom BEM class if the grid is used elsewhere on the site. Getting Started With Basic Grid Structure​ When using ACSS utility classes, we add our grid structure to our parent container. All grid classes start with We have full 12-column grid support using both classes and variables. If we want a 3-column grid, we would add the class to the parent container or div. We then add divs inside the parent container, which act as cells holding elements. These default to full width, but we can set widths on individual cells as needed. Setting Up Grid Gaps​ You can use classes on the grid container to create spacing between rows and columns. However, the preferred way to add a gap to grids is with the contextual utility class, or the contextual variable, . The grid-gap utilities create a separation of styles so you can control the grid spacing across your site independently from other types of spacing. The value for these utilities is set in the ACSS dashboard. ACSS .grid-gap If you need grid gap variations, we recommend using simple functions. For example, will create a gap that is double your standard grid-gap. Equal Height Columns​ We can add a class of to our parent wrapper to ensure all cells in our grid are equal height. This ensures all cells will grow to the height of the tallest cell. Grids On Sections​ It’s possible to turn a into a grid, though this creates significant and unnecessary limitations. For 99% of use cases, you should always use the container in your section as the grid or add a new container or div to create your grid layout. This allows you to put content above and below your grid, within the same section, without breaking the layout. Responsive Grids​ We have full control of our grid across responsive breakpoints. This is done by adding classes that change the structure across the various breakpoints. For example, let’s say we need a grid to be four columns on desktop, two columns at the “L” breakpoint and one column at the “M” breakpoint. Here are the classes you would apply to your grid container: Combining grid and grid breakpoint classes helps you achieve fully responsive grids in seconds. Uneven Grids​ To create uneven grids, we can use classes that set fractional units, such as . This would create a two-column grid that is 1 part to 2 parts, or small first column and larger second column. The following uneven grids are available: grid–1-2 grid–2-1 grid–1-3 grid–3-1 grid–3-2 grid–2-3 Row and Column Spans​ We can control the span of each grid cell, specifying what column and row it starts on. Column span classes allow us to take a cell out of its grid structure and span a specific number of columns using classes like . Column Span Example Similarly, a row span class will force the cell to span the number of rows we specify. Row Span Example We also have full control over all breakpoints : , for example, would make it span back to one column at the L breakpoint. Note: Whenever you use spans, it’s important to override the spans at the appropriate breakpoints. Cells hold onto the instruction until you tell them otherwise. Grid Cell Order​ We have full control of the order of grid cells and can easily set them to display first or last at any breakpoint. Examples: and will affect all breakpoints. forces the cell to appear first at the l breakpoint and below. All breakpoints are available. forces the cell to appear last at the mobile breakpoint. Starts & Ends​ Another way to control grid item position is to tell each item where to start and end within the grid. This is done using the , , , and classes. Let’s say you have a 12-column grid and want the first item to start on column 1 and end on column 9. You would use the following classes: . The same is true for row positioning. If you want the item to end on the last column, you can use which will span all columns regardless of the number of columns in the grid. will do the same for rows. If you want grid items to overlap, you can force them to share columns and/or rows. Grid Content Alignment​ Grid controls allow for the alignment of “Grid Content” (Different from Grid Items.). “Content” refers to the grid items as a whole unit. Content can be justified or aligned only when extra space exists in the Grid container (not just within its cells). Note: Content alignment and justification have no effect when the flexbox has only a single line and/or no available space within the Flexbox. Prefix​ Conventions​ Common Flex Positions​ | | | | | | Grid Items Alignment​ Grid Items are direct children of the cells of the Grid container. Unlike Flexbox, you can align and justify items in a grid. Justifying items in a Grid positions them along the column axis of the grid. Aligning items in a Grid positions them along the row axis of the grid. In Automatic, you have full control over item alignment at each breakpoint. Prefix​ Conventions​ . Common Flex Positions​ | | | | If we want to center content in a grid cell horizontally, we would add to the grid container.

Where grid classes are great for workflow speed, the variables are best for scalability and maintainability. Using Grid Variables​ Sometimes, it’s best to avoid using utility classes to create grids. For example, if you need to create a grid of service cards that will be used on multiple pages and you want to maintain global control over the structure of all your service card grids, it’s best to create a BEM class for defining your grid structure. Here’s an example: To make the grid responsive, you’ll want to define a new grid structure at a different breakpoint: Since you’ve already defined the grid with the display property, you don’t have to set the display property again. All you have to do is change the number of columns. Note: If your page builder supports grid variables, you can use these variables directly in the builder inputs. Writing CSS isn’t required in this scenario. All grids structures are available from 1 to 12 columns as well as our unbalanced grids: Column/Row Spans & Advanced Grids​ You can absolutely achieve very advanced grids using grid variables as the starting point.

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageVariable Grid is a unique, powerful, lightweight, automatically responsive grid system that’s not currently found in any other framework. In this article, we’ll discuss how Variable Grids work and when you should and shouldn’t use them. How Variable Grids work​ In a traditional grid system, grid cells stack at specific breakpoints (based on your choices at each breakpoint). This means that the grid is responding to the size of the device or window and not the size of the elements in the grid. In our Variable Grid system, grid cells stack automatically when items in the grid are squeezed to their minimum allowed width. Instead of the grid responding to a specific device size, it responds only to the current width of its children. One of the problems with the traditional grid system, other than needing a ton of utility classes to pull it off, is that you can’t always protect child elements from getting too narrow. If the “too narrow” point happens between breakpoints, there’s not much you can do about it. With Variable Grids, this is never a problem. You decide what the minimum allowed width for items in the grid is, and the Variable Grid will fill itself at each breakpoint accordingly. Benefits of Variable Grids​ There are some benefits to Variable Grids over traditional grids: Automatically responsive. You don’t have to make decisions at different breakpoints. Works very similar to container queries, but without container queries & easier than container queries. The grid responds to the child’s size rather than to device breakpoints. Low-input. It’s two utilities, max. Lightweight. The entire Variable Grid system is five lines of code (vs. 430 lines for utility classes for a traditional grid system). There are no column count limitations. Unlike other grid systems, there are no column-count utilities. You can have anywhere from 1 to 1000 (assuming 1000 items are small enough to fit in a row). Variable Grids are simpler to manipulate dynamically. You can use Javascript to quickly set or change the grid structure on the fly. Limitations of Variable Grids​ Variable Grids aren’t perfect for every situation. If you want tight control over the number of columns in the grid or the number of columns at each breakpoint, or you want uneven columns, you might want to opt for traditional grids. The first two things are controllable with Variable Grids, but you might find that achieving this level of control with Variable Grids is a little more cumbersome. Uneven columns are not achievable without spans, and once you get into this level of manipulation, you should question your decision to use a Variable Grid in the first place. How to create a Variable Grid​ There are three ways to create a variable grid: utility class, variable-grid-columns recipe, and variable-grid recipe. To create a variable grid with the utility class, simply assign the class to any box. Unlike our other grid systems, there are no additional classes to use. If the box is the content width of your website, like a traditional container, you’ll immediately get two equal columns that are automatically responsive. In some cases (like a 50/50 content layout), this may fit your needs perfectly. You can move on without giving the grid any additional input. In cases where you need more than two columns or you have elements that are sensitive to specific widths (like cards), the next step is to tell the Variable Grid what the minimum width is. This is done with the utility. Typically you’ll want to set this value at the ID level so it only applies to that specific instance of variable grid. In a page builder like Bricks, you can set the value of the variable two ways. The first method is to add the via the custom CSS tab. This is probably the fastest, most obvious, and most maintainable method. Note: Do not attach this custom CSS to the class itself. That would apply the same width to every instance of variable grids across your website. Since the grids you’ll be building are all different, you want to assign the to each unique instance. This is best done at the ID level. The second method is to add the –min via the data attributes feature: This adds the as an inline CSS style which, by default, only applies to that unique instance of your grid. We named this “Variable Grid” because of the variable nature of how they behave and the fact that it’ll help remind you that they’re based on a variable. The recipe methods allow you to attach variable grids to custom classes. gives you the literal grid-template-columns value for Variable Grid. Type the name of the recipe and hit enter in the input and it’ll expand to the full value. You can then use the variable as shown above, but this time you can attach the to the custom class you made for the grid. The second recipe method is the full recipe for Variable Grid. On your custom grid class, navigate to the CSS input and then type –– as soon as you type “;” on the end, the recipe will expand. The full recipe gives you all the Variable Grid code, including a that you can customize. Understanding ​ There are two ways to use . The first is to set a minimum allowed width for grid children (literal use). The second is to use as more of an “optimal” width. Variable grids work by filling the grid with as many children as will fit in a row, according to the minimum width. As long as the minimum width hasn’t been achieved, the grid will keep filling the row with more items. Let’s say you’re creating a grid of team member cards. In your mind, you want a three-column grid. But when you set according to the bare minimum you want those cards to ever be, the grid might turn out to be a four-column grid. Instead of choosing a bare minimum value, you can choose a slightly bigger minimum value. With this new minimum, the grid may now only fit three cards in a row. All good! Changing var(–min) at breakpoints​ Variable Grids are automatically responsive. A downside of this is that you might find an uneven grid at a specific breakpoint, or even an orphaned item. In CSS Grid land, this is seen as perfectly acceptable, though it offends some people’s OCD. Thankfully, if your OCD is triggered by this, it’s a fixable solution. You can re-assign the value of at any breakpoint. All you have to do is choose a new value that restructures the grid to your desired configuration. Being OCD about this will limit the “automatic” nature of Variable Grids, but that’s the tradeoff. Setting or changing var(–min) dynamically with Javascript​ If you’re in a situation where you need to set or change the behavior a grid (like the number of items per row) dynamically with Javascript, Variable Grids might be a good option. Instead of having to dynamically add or remove classes, or create additional variables, you can simply change the value of dynamically with inline CSS. Have fun!​ Variable Grids are not the be-all, end-all of CSS Grid, but they’re extremely helpful in a variety of situations that require even grids. The fact that they’re so lightweight is a huge benefit as well.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageThe ACSS Icon Framework makes icon styling a breeze. It’s turned on by default on all new installs, but you can double check that it’s enabled by going to Dashboard > Icons. Styling Icons​ Add an icon to your site using the SVG, Icon, or Code elements. To apply Icon Framework styling to your icon, you need to add the data attribute . Here’s an example of how to do this in Bricks: The presence of does all the work. Once that attribute is present, ACSS is controlling all relevant icon styles by default and the entire Icon Framework is available to you for tweaking. Note: If using a code element, make sure the code is rendered without a wrapper and that data-icon is added directly to the element, like this: Icon Style: Boxed vs Naked​ Boxed icons have padding, a background color, border color, etc. You can choose between boxed or naked icons at any time on an icon-by-icon basis, but you can also set the default style for your site in Icon Options. Benefits of Boxed Icons​ Easier to achieve perfect alignment of icons More styling options and more hover options Typically looks more consistent Easier to cover up imperfections in icon sizes/sets. If the majority of the icons in your design are boxed, set the default to boxed. If the majority are naked, set the default to naked. Navigate to Icons > Icon Framework Options and toggle Boxed Icons on/off: Default Icon Theme & Styling​ To get started, set your Global Icon Theme as well as your Default Icon Style. Screenshot There are two icon themes to choose from: Light and Dark. For maximum flexibility in how you use icons across a website, it’s important for the theme name to match the actual icon color, NOT the boxed styling. For the Dark Theme, you should set a dark icon color. For the Light Theme, you should set a light icon color. The styles are not based on the boxed icon styling. The reason for this is simple. If you want to convert an individual icon from boxed to naked, or vice versa, the icon color should not change. If you base the theme styles on the box styling, your icon color may change when you convert an individual icon to naked. Global Styles are styles that affect all icons regardless of whether they’re Light or Dark. Default Icon Style – The color style an icon will inherit by default. Icon Padding (Boxed Only) – The padding around your icon (creates the box). Icon Border Width (Boxed Only) – The thickness of the border on the icon box. Icon Border Style (Boxed Only) – The style of the border on the icon box. Icon Radius (Boxed Only) – The radius of the border on the icon box. Configuring the Light and Dark Theme Styles​ Screenshot Once you’ve set your default styles, you can set the following styles related to the Dark or Light icon set. Icon Color – The color of the icon. Icon Background (Boxed Only) – The background color of the icon box. Border Color (Boxed Only) – The color of the border on the icon box. Box Shadow (Boxed Only) – The shadow around the icon box. Each of these, except , have hover variants you can set by clicking the cursor icon next to the input field. Icon Sizes​ By default, you have three icon sizes to choose from with the default being “M” or Medium. Three options should be enough for most projects, but if you need more you can navigate to Icons > Options and turn on Expand Icon Sizes. To change the size of an icon, use . This can be placed on an individual icon or on a group of icons. For example, will make an icon(s) adopt the large values. You control the size of these options from the Icon Sizes accordion. When Boxed Icons is turned on, you can also control the padding values for each size. By default they reference your general icon padding value, which is relative to the size. Tip: If you feel you need to adjust icon padding, try adjusting the default icon padding value first rather than adjusting the padding of each individual size. This is more likely to maintain padding consistency. Icon Lists​ The Icon Framework has support for icon lists, which also have separate styling options. You can turn a list into an icon list by applying either the attribute to the list element ( or ) or by using the utility class . Either will work: This assumes your icons in the list are still placed with icon elements, SVGs, or Code elements. The framework does not support pseudo element icons out of the box due to CSS limitations. Once you have an icon list, you can adjust styles accordingly: Boxed List Icons – You can turn off the box styling for list icons if needed. Icon Size – The default size of an icon in a list. List Gap – The space between list items in your list. Inline Offset – If the spacing seems off, you can nudge your icons left or right. Block Offset – If the spacing seems off, you can nudge your icons up or down. Overriding the Icon Theme Manually​ There are two ways to change the icon theme manually, a utility class and a data attribute. Both methods work on individual icons as well as groups of icons (if applied to the parent). Class Method: You can use or to change the theme. Attribute Method: You can use or to change the theme. Overriding the Icon Style Manually​ There are two ways to change the icon style manually, a utility class and a data attribute. Both methods work on individual icons as well as groups of icons (if applied to the parent). Class Method: You can use or to change the style. Attribute Method: You can use or to change the style. Overriding the Icon Size Manually​ There are two ways to change the icon size manually, a utility class and a data attribute. Both methods work on individual icons as well as groups of icons (if applied to the parent). Class Method: You can use to change the size. Attribute Method: You can use to change the size. The accepted values are t-shirt sizes: s, m, l, etc. Overriding Icon Styles with Custom CSS​ Every property in the Icon Framework is represented as a variable, making it easy to reference or override any style at any time. You can also deploy icon styling to any icon using the icon() mixin. Notice for Bricks Users: Bricks uses inappropriate specificity for their default icon styling. In order to override this, we have to use additional specificity. This means that if you write custom CSS to style icons, the styles may not apply. You can use a double root selector for your custom CSS to resolve this.",

Additionally, it’s important to remember that arguments are answered in order and you can’t answer a second argument without answering a first argument.

Additionally, you should keep in mind that the best scenario for overriding the box styling is when you have boxed icons set as the default and you need a specific icon or group of icons to not have boxed styling.

They will not work in the builder inputs or builder CSS. It’s common to use 3rd party plugins on WordPress websites or run into scenarios where you need to apply button styling to specific elements that you can’t necessary apply a button class to. Some of these plugins, like e-commerce plugins, form plugins, etc. contain buttons that need to match the style of all your other buttons. This is a perfect use case for a button mixin. Note: Button mixins are part of ACSS’ SCSS structure, so they can’t be used in regular CSS fields. You’ll need to use the mixin in the Custom SCSS area of the ACSS dashboard. ​ The main button mixin in ACSS is the mixin. This mixin allows you to attach any ACSS button style to any link/button element you’d like. You can use it like this: The above code will make exactly match your website’s primary button style. Available Styles​ You can replace “primary” in the above example with any valid ACSS button style: primary primary-light primary-dark primary.btn–outline primary-light.btn–outline primary-dark.btn–outline secondary secondary-light secondary-dark secondary.btn–outline secondary-light.btn–outline secondary-dark.btn–outline tertiary tertiary-light tertiary-dark tertiary.btn–outline tertiary-light.btn–outline tertiary-dark.btn–outline accent accent-light accent-dark accent.btn–outline accent-light.btn–outline accent-dark.btn–outline base base-light base-dark base.btn–outline base-light.btn–outline base-dark.btn–outline neutral neutral-light neutral-dark neutral.btn–outline neutral-light.btn–outline neutral-dark.btn–outline Note: To use the versions, you’ll need to wrap the entire style name in quotes, like this: Dealing With Specificity Issues​ In the above example, could be an element that already has styles applied to it. If these styles contain greater specificity than your CSS instructions, or are placed in a stylesheet that comes after ACSS’ custom CSS, the mixin won’t work unless you increase specificity. One way you can increase specificity without actually altering HTML is to double-reference the selector, like this: Another way you can increase specificity is to use a page builder’s html/body/main ID (if one exists) to start your CSS declaration. For example, Bricks uses an ID on their main tag, so you can use it to increase specificity without altering HTML, like this: If the mixin isn’t working for some reason, or is partially working, you’ll need to calculate the specificity of the default styles you’re trying to override, and then produce higher specificity with your mixin targeting.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageOne of the most common accessibility mistakes in web design involves clickable cards and content groups. When you wrap a card or group of content with a link, you physically contain multiple pieces of content within the link. This is inadvisable for two reasons: Nesting block content (images, headings, etc.) within inline elements (a link) is bad practice. Grouping more than one piece of announced content within a link creates poor accessibility. When users with assistive technology focus on your link, the assistive technology will do one of two things: It’ll try to announce all announceable items, or it’ll simply read out the hyperlink with no additional context. Both outcomes are confusing and annoying to users. Additionally, your link will have no technical or semantic meaning because it contains too many different items. Here’s a video that covers this topic in detail: Stop Making This BIG Mistake With Clickable Cards (Use \"Clickable Parent\" & \"Focus Parent\" Instead) - YouTube An Example (Right vs Wrong)​ Here’s a card that is wrapped in a link. Use a screen reader or Apple Voiceover to interact with it. You’ll see that the accessibility is poor. Clickable Card​ This is a sample card with text. Everything is wrapped in a link, which causes screen readers to try and announce everything. It’s super annoying and technically wrong. Below is a card that uses the “clickable parent” technique. Focus on it and hear how it’s announced. The assistive technology will announce it as “clickable card.” Clickable Card​ This is a sample card with text. It uses clickable parent, so only the heading is announced. It’s much better. Imagine this was a service card in a grid of services, with the card heading being the name of each service. When using Clickable Parent, assistive technology will properly read out each service name, making it very clear to the user what they’re interacting with and where each link will navigate to. Additionally, for contextual purposes, SEO, and general page indexing, the link’s anchor text is 100% clear and exactly matches the destination. This is how links are supposed to be structured. The Approach​ You can’t wrap a group of content in a link, but you still need the entire group of content to be clickable, right? To accomplish this, we need to add a link to the heading of the content group and then extend its clickable area to fill the entire card. This is done using an absolutely positioned pseudo-element. You don’t need to know all the technical details of how to implement this. You just need to know that ACSS provides two utilities for easily doing this. We also provide an additional utility that will change the focus behavior of your clickable content group if desired. The two utilities are: The Clickable Parent utility class​ To use the utility class, create a card or group of content and then add the destination link to the heading within that content (typically an or ). Next, add the class to the heading. Since we’re using an absolutely positioned pseudo-element, the final step is to change the position of the parent container (the container which contains all the children of the group – the thing you want people to click) to position relative. If you don’t change the parent to position relative, the clickable area of the link will extend beyond the bounds of the content group and affect other elements on your page. This is undesirable, so don’t forget to set the parent to position relative. Congrats! Now you have a clickable content group (a clickable parent element) with the correct link structure and accessibility. Note: Sometimes builders set certain elements to position relative. Anything that is position-relative is automatically elevated above the clickable area. This will break the clickable nature of your content group. It’s essential to ensure that all elements within your clickable content group are set to position static (this is the default position so it’s typically not necessary to do this manually). The Clickable Parent mixin​ The downside to using the clickable parent class is that you have to apply it multiple times if you have multiple clickable groups (like cards in a grid). This isn’t very scalable or maintainable. If you have multiple clickable content groups and are using BEM classes, you may want to opt for using our Clickable Parent mixin. Note: This mixin must be added to a SCSS stylesheet. It will not work in a vanilla CSS stylesheet. If you’re not using SCSS and aren’t familiar with SCSS, then stick with the utility class method above. Here’s an example of the Clickable Parent mixin in use: Note: The mixin should be used on the actual or element. That’s it! Clickable Parent in Bricks Builder With BEM Classes​ Not using SCSS, but still want to use clickable-parent with custom classes? In Bricks, you can easily do this with the new %root% selector in the CSS input of any element. Just assign this CSS (we recommend adding it to the parent element, especially if you’re going to be using the Focus Parent technique: Let’s assume you have a card with a clickable heading (typical use case). Here’s what it would look like (assuming you’re using BEM and gave your heading the class structure of : Notice that I have selected the actual clickable element, which, in this case, is the element that’s inside the heading. If your clickable element is a button, you would simply select the button. Focus Parent​ It’s common to want to combine the clickable-parent technique with another technique called focus-parent. Where clickable parent extends the clickable area of a link to cover an entire parent element, focus-parent alters the focus behavior of that parent element and its children. In other words, the focus-parent technique also allows your entire clickable element to be focusable. This extends the same click and hover effects that clickable-parent provides to keyboard users. Learn about focus-parent Wrap-Up​ 95% of web designers fail to implement clickable content groups correctly. The result is poor link structure, semantic structure, and accessibility. With ACSS, you can structure things properly in seconds with minimal effort. This is yet another example of how ACSS promotes best practices, helps enhance accessibility, and helps you build better websites with less effort.",

In other words, the focus-parent technique also allows your entire clickable element to be focusable.

You could optionally use the outline style by replacing the second instruction with this: Whether you use the box-shadow or outline focus style depends on the situation and the effect you’re trying to achieve.

They will not work in the builder inputs or builder CSS. It’s common to need to fade out content into the background. And in an ideal world, you don’t want to have to match the fade color effect with the background color. Rather, you want the fade out to work regardless of color choices, background textures, etc. This is precisely what ACSS’ Gradient Fades feature handles for you. You can see an example of this in the Frames layout, Hero Barcelona. Note: If you don’t have a Frames license, you should definitely get one here. As you can see in the above example, the images appear to fade into the background of the section. This is accomplished with ACSS’ fade utilities. Getting Started​ The fade effect can be applied with fade utility classes, the fade() mixin, or fade recipes. If you want to use the utility classes, make sure they’re activated in Options > Utility Classes > Fade Classes. The recipe and mixin() are available at all times, even when the utility classes are deactivated. Fade Utility Classes​ Apply classes using the syntax . The accepted axis extensions are: , , , , , . “Block” fades out both sides of the block axis. “Inline” fades out both sides of the inline access. The others do exactly what you’d expect them to do. Once applied, you can adjust the fade amount using a locally scoped variable , either on a custom class or at the ID level. Fade Mixin​ The fade mixin works in the custom SCSS area of the ACSS dashboard. Choose and element and . The argument is not required. It will default to 25%. Fade Recipes​ Each axis option has an associated recipe. The following will expand the fade out code: Remember that you can’t paste these recipe strings. They’ll only expand when the semicolon on the end is actually typed. That’s it, have fun!",

Sometimes this can be accomplished with a capable page builder via PHP, but sometimes it’s only possible with CSS (assuming you don’t want to introduce unnecessary JS). In Automatic.css, clamping lines to a specific line count is as easy as adding the a utility class or calling a @line-clamp recipe.

They will not work in the builder inputs or builder CSS. Imagine you have a magic recipe book. In this book, you can write down all the instructions for making your favorite meals. But, instead of reading the recipe and following the directions every time you want to make one of your meals, all you have to do is say the name of the recipe, and poof! All the instructions appear. That’s kind of like what SCSS mixins do, but for styling websites. How Mixins Work​ In SCSS (which is like a super-powered version of CSS), mixins are like those magic meal recipes. You write them once, give them a name, and then you can use them over and over in different places without writing all the code again. We use mixins a lot in ACSS, internally, to output parts of the framework. The really cool part is that you can use our mixins, too! The only caveat is that you have to use them in the “Custom SCSS” area of the ACSS dashboard. Since most page builders don’t include a SCSS pre-processor, you can’t use them in the builder inputs or normal CSS boxes. Using a Mixin​ Mixins are used by referencing the name of the mixin using the syntax. For example, here’s how use our button mixin: It’s like saying “Hey ACSS, please put all those cool button styles here!” But that’s not all. Mixins can have “arguments” as well, which can manipulate the code the mixin writes for you. For example, our button mixin accepts a argument, that asks for the style of button you want to output. Here’s an example of outputting everything associated with the “secondary” button style: That’s actually not the only argument the button mixin accepts. There’s a second argument called , which decides whether the main button property keys are output in the code or not. This argument excepts a “yes” or “no” – do you want to output the full list of keys, or not? The above code would output ONLY the locally scoped variables that produce the secondary button style, but it wouldn’t actually output the property keys. You’d want to do this when you’ve named your custom button with a prefix, given that ACSS automatically outputs the property keys for any class that starts with . It’s a more efficient approach to changing a button’s style. You don’t have to worry about how this all works right now as it’s specific to buttons. I just wanted to give an example of having multiple arguments in a mixin. Why did the earlier mixin examples work without answering the arguments?​ The previous mixin examples work without answering the arguments, or only answering one argument, because both arguments have a default value. The default for is “primary” and the default value of is “yes.” Arguments often have default values to avoid having to answer them every single time the mixin is used, but there are still two things you have to remember about mixin arguments: Arguments have to answered in order, so it’s important to read and understand the documentation for a mixin before you use it. If you want to answer an argument that isn’t the first argument, you have to answer each argument that comes before it as well. So, again, it’s important to read and understand the documentation for a mixin before you use it. Why Mixins are Awesome​ They save time: You write the code once and use it many times (or in this case, you get to access/use mixins without ever having to write them). They keep things tidy: Your code stays organized and easy to read. They’re flexible: You can change them in one place and it updates everywhere. They keep everything you’re doing 100% consistent with what ACSS was already doing elsewhere. So, next time you’re styling a website, remember mixins are like your magical recipe book for making things look awesome!",

They provide a way to layer content or images on a web page, giving you the flexibility to create eye-catching designs and improve readability. Why use overlays?​ A perfect example of why we would use overlays would be if we have a container or section that has a background image with some title text yet the text may be illegible. Overlays are perfect for resolving this issue. In ACSS, overlay classes define the appearance of an overlay allowing us to use the brand colors and transparencies set in ACSS.

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageSticky elements stick to the top of the browser window (with or without an offset) as the user scrolls down the page. Sticky elements differ from “fixed” position elements in that they’re statically positioned until they interact with the top of the browser window. They also will lose their stickiness when they reach the end of their parent container. You can make any element sticky in ACSS with a single class: After making an element sticky, you probably also want to control its offset. The offset is the gap between the top of the browser window and the top of the sticky element. The default offset in ACSS is “0,” which means the element will touch the top of the browser window if you don’t choose a different offset value. There are three ways to control sticky offset behavior in ACSS. Automatic Sticky Offsets in Automatic.css​ Automatic sticky offset is the best practice behavior in ACSS because it gives you global control over the offset value of all your sticky elements, which is usually the desired outcome. It also allows you to create sticky elements with one class instead of two. In the ACSS dashboard, click on “Additional Styling.” Scroll down until you see Sticky Settings and make sure you turn on “Offset Sticky Automatically.” Sticky Styling Next, find the Scroll Styling controls in the same tab. These controls are designed for “scroll to hashlink” functionality but also control automatic sticky offset values because scroll-to-hash and sticky functionality both need the same type of offset for best usability. Scroll Offsets Panel The value you put in the scroll offset box will be the offset for all your sticky elements. You can define an offset at each breakpoint to ensure your offsets are responsive. All you have to do is put the class on any element and your offset is automatically taken care of. You can adjust the offset value anytime, and all your sticky elements will update accordingly. Manual Sticky Offsets With Utility Classes​ If you don’t use automatic offsets as detailed above, you’ll want to use the sticky offset modifier classes on your sticky elements. There are three modifier classes to choose from: They’re called “sticky-top” because, with sticky elements, you must define a “top” value (the space away from the top of the viewport). The extensions stand for “small,” “medium,” and “large.” These three modifier classes are customizable from the Sticky Settings panel in “Additional Styling.” Just open the Sticky Styling panel in Additional Styling. Sticky Styling Panel By default, these values are expressed as percentages, but you can use any valid CSS measurement unit. Note: You can still use these when “Offset Sticky Elements Automatically” is turned on. They’ll override your automatic offset value, giving you one-off control of certain sticky elements. Manual Sticky Offsets With Custom Classes or ID Styling​ You can make your own sticky offset class or change the offset of any element at the ID level. Once you’ve added the .sticky class to an element, manually set its “top” value in the page builder or with custom CSS. Remember that while this is possible, it’s probably not practical. If you style an element with a custom class, then you should probably just add the sticky behavior yourself.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageRecipes are a new feature in ACSS v3.0. They’re a very powerful new part of our variable expansion and validation system. What’s a Recipe?​ A Recipe is a block of CSS that you can use wherever needed. It works similar to how a SCSS mixin works, but instead of just referencing the block of CSS, the Recipe functionality fully exposes the underlying code. For example, let’s say you want to turn a big block of paragraphs into a multi-column layout. In ACSS, you could do this with our Columns utilities. The downside is that you need to use utility classes, which aren’t always appropriate. Columns functionality is not something that can be mapped to a CSS variable, so there was no other option for creating columns without writing the CSS yourself, prior to Recipes. With Recipes, you simply open the rich text element that houses your paragraphs, create a class if you want to assign the Recipe to a class, and then type “@” plus the name of the recipe: Calling a Recipe in ACSS Close the line with “;” just as you normally would and the Recipe will appear instantly: Expanded version of a Recipe in ACSS Some recipes are very simple and some are complex. It just depends on the utility that you happen to be expanding. Using Recipes in Input Fields​ Some Recipes are simply the exposed value of a specific variable and can be used as single values in input fields. For example, you can expose all the partials for a color with the Recipe “.” Let’s say you want to create a custom transparency or use a tweaked version of an existing color within the ACSS system. Prior to 3.0, you’d have to write your own HSL string manually using color partials: But, with ACSS Recipes, all you have to type is ““ Once you type and hit Enter, the Recipe instantly expands into the full HSL string. Now you can simply change the transparency value, any of the H, S, or L values, or even calc part of the HSL. Since the HSL uses variable partials, whatever part of the string you don’t edit remains fully hooked into the ACSS system for maximum maintainability. Recipes & Stylesheet Efficiency​ For users who want to turn off sets of utility classes, Recipes can be a great way to continue accessing the functionality of those utilities on a case-by-case basis. Using our example above, you could turn off “Columns” classes in ACSS, which removes all the columns utilities from the stylesheet (making your stylesheet lighter). If you need columns on your project, you cans simply use to get the functionality wherever its needed without having to load all the columns utilities. The future of Recipes​ ACSS 3.0 ships with some initial Recipes for popular non-variable-driven utilities (columns, masonry, clickable parent, focus parent, flex-grid, color expansion, and more). We’ll quickly expand Recipes functionality to all utilities that will provide great value to the user. In addition to pre-configured Recipes provided by the framework, we have plans to allow for custom Recipes and Recipe-sharing. You’ll be able to write and save your own Recipes and import/export those recipes between sites. You can also share Recipes or groups of Recipes with other users (in the future). Recipes introduce a big leap forward in workflow efficiency that we’re proud to bring to the ACSS ecosystem.",

Pro Tip: Instead of redeclaring properties like padding, font-size, etc. just declare new values for the custom properties that are used throughout the card framework. Nesting Styles​ Native CSS now supports nesting, which you can leverage to keep all your container query CSS inside a single query (unless you’re designing for multiple size contexts).

They will not work in the builder inputs or builder CSS. It’s common to need to fade out content into the background. And in an ideal world, you don’t want to have to match the fade color effect with the background color. Rather, you want the fade out to work regardless of color choices, background textures, etc. This is precisely what ACSS’ Gradient Fades feature handles for you. You can see an example of this in the Frames layout, Hero Barcelona. Note: If you don’t have a Frames license, you should definitely get one here. As you can see in the above example, the images appear to fade into the background of the section. This is accomplished with ACSS’ fade utilities. Getting Started​ The fade effect can be applied with fade utility classes, the fade() mixin, or fade recipes. If you want to use the utility classes, make sure they’re activated in Options > Utility Classes > Fade Classes. The recipe and mixin() are available at all times, even when the utility classes are deactivated. Fade Utility Classes​ Apply classes using the syntax . The accepted axis extensions are: , , , , , . “Block” fades out both sides of the block axis. “Inline” fades out both sides of the inline access. The others do exactly what you’d expect them to do. Once applied, you can adjust the fade amount using a locally scoped variable , either on a custom class or at the ID level. Fade Mixin​ The fade mixin works in the custom SCSS area of the ACSS dashboard. Choose and element and . The argument is not required. It will default to 25%.

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageOverlap recipes allow you to quickly create two different types of overlap effects in your design. Benefits & Compatibilities​ Traditional overlap techniques all have various pros and cons. The technique deployed with the recipe has far more upsides than any other technique and a smaller list of cons. Can be applied to classes or IDs. Can be manipulated per-instance separately from the class application. Supports background color, background image, and background patterns. Supports all background attachments, sizes, repeats, etc. including fixed backgrounds. Supports an overlay color including gradient overlays. Supports masks, clip paths, and custom border radii. Supports background styles on the same container. ​ Overlap is a simple recipe for adding an overlap effect to any box with some unique benefits. The overlap is effectively a background-type style that extends from the top of the box to a stopping point prior to the bottom of the box. The stopping point is user-editable. ​ Overlap-alt example deploys a background to the adjacent sibling box with the overlap extending up into the target box. Native Properties for Customization​ The following variables / custom properties are available for immediate customization when using the recipe: –background: Sets the background using any valid shorthand background value. –foreground: Sets the foreground color of the adjacent content group (headings and paragraphs by default). –overlap-amount: Sets the amount of overlap. –overlay: Sets the overlay color or gradient. Background Images and Patterns​ Any valid shorthand background property value will work with the variable. This means you can use images and patterns as your overlap effect. You can also declare an overlay for your background using the property. Customizing the Overlay​ By default, the overlay is set to transparent. To create a uniform overlay, replace both instances of “transparent” with the same transparent color: To create a gradient overlay, set two different values: You can use any valid linear gradient, but maintaining the linear-gradient value is required for the overlay to work. Border Radius​ You can use border radius on your overlap effect by adding border-radius to the pseudo element. Masks & Clip Paths​ You can create fancier overlap/divider techniques with the use of masks and clip paths. Clip path divider overlap In the above example, we’re using a clip path to create an angled divider overlap effect. You can apply masks and clip paths to the pseudo element: Many other possibilities are available depending on your level of skill, so feel free to play and experiment with this recipe!",

When advanced users primarily use variables with custom classes, the ACSS framework becomes unnecessarily heavy. All the utility classes are being loaded in the stylesheet, but aren’t getting used. Enter Pro Mode. Options > Utility Classes Dashboard Pro Mode is a new button inside the ACSS options panel that automatically turns off parts of the framework that our professional users have identified as being [often] unnecessary to pro users who are committed to using variables and custom classes. While the utility classes for these areas of the framework are turned off, the variables still work, giving Pro users the exact same level of power, but without the bloat of utilities that aren’t being leveraged. When Pro Mode is activated, the ACSS framework is roughly 50% lighter. If you also turn off any colors or buttons you aren’t using, the framework can be up to 80% lighter. If you are an advanced user, this is the way we recommend you work with the framework. Before You Enable Pro Mode​ Since Pro Mode deactivates large areas of the framework, it’s not reasonable to activate Pro Mode after a website is built. This will break anything that relies on utility classes from the parts of the framework that were turned off. Pro Mode is best activated before beginning development on a new project. Or, early on in development when you can quickly fix anything that breaks and then make the transition to a custom class workflow. How to Enable Pro Mode​ Enabling Pro Mode is easy: Open the ACSS Dashboard Navigate to the Options Panel Scroll down to the Framework Settings section Click “Activate” on the Pro Mode option “Classless Workflow”​ You can think of “classless workflow” as “Beast Mode.” It deactivates ALL utility classes, leaving you with only variables. It creates an insanely lightweight framework. Please note that you can turn on individual utility modules after activating either Pro Mode or Classless Workflow, so it’s never a black and white situation that you’re locked into.",

It also allows you to set custom breakpoints that match the specific WordPress page builder you’re using. Setting Website Width​ To set your website’s width, open the Viewport tab in the ACSS dashboard and change the Website Width input to your desired value: Website Dimensions Panel It’s essential that the website width in ACSS settings matches the website width or container width that you’ve set in your page builder. The framework has to know your website’s dimensions in order for things like responsive typography, responsive spacing, and auto grids to function accurately. Setting Basic Breakpoints​ ACSS has the following breakpoint options by default: XL (Laptop) L (Vertical Tablet) M (Horizontal Phone) S (Vertical Phone) It’s best practice to make sure your largest breakpoint is equal to the website width you set in the Website Dimensions area (unless you’re using the extra breakpoints as detailed below). Breakpoints are customizable via the Viewport tab: Breakpoints Setup Panel The most important thing to understand when setting up breakpoints is that they must align with the values you’ve set in your page builder. If the page builder and ACSS use two different sets of breakpoints, your responsiveness will be inconsistent. Whatever changes you make to breakpoint values here must also be set in your page builder. noteBecause of the way some page builders show breakpoints in the builder (Oxygen Builder, for example), it may be necessary to set up your builder breakpoints at 1px less than your ACSS breakpoint values for maximum accuracy in the builder. Follow the latest setup documentation for your specific builder – do not blindly follow old video tutorials. Additional Breakpoints​ Aside from the standard breakpoints, ACSS offers two additional breakpoints that are optional. These breakpoints are off by default, but can easily be turned on in the Viewport tab: XXL and XS Breakpoint Activation The XXL breakpoint is helpful if you design a site above the average width. Most websites are between 1140 and 1280px. If you design a site at 1366px, 1440px, or higher, you’ll likely find value in enabling the XXL breakpoint and shifting the other breakpoint values to minimize the gap between your largest breakpoint and the next breakpoint down. If you find too much of a gap between one breakpoint and another, activating the XS breakpoint as an additional option can help. Mapping Breakpoints in Bricks Builder​ Whether you’re sticking to the standard breakpoints or adding additional breakpoints, we recommend mapping all your ACSS breakpoints over to Bricks. This will keep the names and values consistent and ensure your site works fluidly. First, ensure you’ve turned on Custom Breakpoints in Bricks’ settings: Bricks Custom Breakpoint Settings Once that’s enabled, you can edit breakpoints in Bricks from any page as long as you have the builder open. In the builder, click the three dots next to the breakpoints to open the editor panel. Bricks Breakpoint Editor Panel Bricks sets the top breakpoint as the “base” breakpoint by default. You can change the value of the base breakpoint, but you should never set any other breakpoint as the base breakpoint. This will break your site. If you’re using standard breakpoints:​ Click the pencil next to the base breakpoint and change the name to “XL.” Make sure the value matches the XL breakpoint value set in ACSS. Click the pencil next to the “tablet portrait” breakpoint and change the name to “L.” Make sure the value matches the L breakpoint value set in ACSS. Click the pencil next to the “mobile landscape” breakpoint and change the name to “M.” Make sure the value matches the M breakpoint value set in ACSS. Click the pencil next to the “mobile portrait” breakpoint and change the name to “S.” Make sure the value matches the S breakpoint value set in ACSS. Now your breakpoint names in Bricks map perfectly to your breakpoint names in ACSS. If you’re using additional breakpoints:​ Click the pencil next to the base breakpoint and change the value to your website width. Click the pencil next to the “tablet portrait” breakpoint and change the name to “L.” Make sure the value matches the L breakpoint value set in ACSS. Click the pencil next to the “mobile landscape” breakpoint and change the name to “M.” Make sure the value matches the M breakpoint value set in ACSS. Click the pencil next to the “mobile portrait” breakpoint and change the name to “S.” Make sure the value matches the S breakpoint value set in ACSS. Click the “+” sign to add a new breakpoint. Set the name to “XXL” and set the value to match the XXL breakpoint value you set in ACSS. Click the “+” sign to add a new breakpoint. Set the name to “XL” and set the value to match the XL breakpoint value you set in ACSS. If you added an XS breakpoint, click the “+” sign to add a new breakpoint. Set the name to “XS” and set the value to match the XS breakpoint value you set in ACSS. Your custom/additional breakpoints now map perfectly to your breakpoint names and values in ACSS.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageContextual Spacing refers to spacing within a specific context. For example, the standard gap value you repeatedly use within grids or the space between content elements. Imagine someone saying, “Use my gap value” on that element. Can you imagine what they’re referring to? Probably not. is a spacing property but doesn’t refer to any meaningful context. When someone says, “Use the grid-gap value,” they give you a reference point. You can look at all grids across the site and see they often use the same gap value. Since consistency is desirable in web design, good designers will use consistent values within repeating contexts. In ACSS, we’ve identified three primary spacing contexts that call for consistency: Container gap Content gap Grid gap We’ve created utilities for these gap values and they’re one of the most important and impactful features in ACSS. Container Gap​ The container gap is the spacing between containers in elements. A container is the direct child div of a element that establishes your website’s content width. It’s often desirable to have multiple containers in a as you work to group associated content. Content Gap​ Content gap is the equal space between all content elements on your website (headings, text, images, list containers, etc.). Grid Gap​ Grid gap is the gap between items in grids and columnized content. Contextual Spacing Setup​ You can set values for these contextual utilities via the ACSS Spacing tab. Contextual Spacing Controls in Automatic.css Notice that we’re not using random values here. We’re using ACSS variables for automatic responsiveness and maximum consistency. We’re really just taking existing variables and giving them a specific context. While this is a simple concept, it’s insanely impactful – so much so that I have no idea why other frameworks don’t encourage this. Using Contextual Spacing​ Once your utilities are setup, start using them in every situation that calls for them. When you have multiple containers in a , use or on that section’s gap property. When you have multiple content elements in a container of any kind, use or to space your content evenly. It’s advisable to make sure you have Smart Spacing turned on in these situations. When you’re using a grid or creating columnized content, use or . Multiple values in one​ What if you’re in a situation where you want a little extra or less spacing than these utilities offer? Should you abandon the utility and use a different utility or custom value instead? No. You should only abandon these utilities if you’re abandoning the context they were created for. That’s rarely the case, so stick with the utility even if it doesn’t give the desired result out of the box. Instead, calc it! Let’s say I actually want double the typical grid gap for an individual grid. This is a really fantastic approach for multiple reasons: I don’t have to think very hard (coming up with a new responsive clamp, for example). I’m not going to litter random values everywhere. I’m not using a spacing variable with no context. If I ever adjust my global grid gap value, this grid will still adjust itself accordingly. The value is relative to a value I use elsewhere, so consistency is maintained. Try it, you’ll fall in love. Automatic Contextual Spacing​ Automatic Contextual Spacing As of version 2.6, you no longer have to manually use contextual utilities within sections, containers, and grids. Simply activate Automatic Contextual Spacing and ACSS will apply the spacing for you automatically. ACSS will target all elements and apply container-gap spacing between divs that are direct children of the element. ACSS will target all divs/containers that are direct children of elements and apply content-gap spacing. ACSS will target all div/block elements in general and apply content-gap spacing. ACSS will target all grids that use grid utility classes and apply grid-gap. To avoid conflicts and make it easy to override automatic spacing, ACSS applies these spacing values with zero specificity. The automatic spacing can be overridden at any point with other utility classes, custom classes, ID styling, inline styling, or global styling with any specificity value.",

There are multiple ways to accomplish the same thing, and nobody has really set a standard for how things should be done. At Automatic.css, we’ve been advocating for a standard for section structure and spacing practices based on the methods that have the most pros and the least cons. Here’s a video that discusses proper section fundamentals: PB101: L04 - How Sections & Containers Work - YouTube Best practices suggest the following: Sections should consist of at least two elements: the itself and and inner . A “gutter” for the website (inline spacing between content and device edge) should be established with inline padding on the element. The inner should be the website’s content width and auto-centered. This should not have any extra inline padding and typically shouldn’t have any padding at all unless it’s going to have its own background styling. If a needs more white space, you should almost always use extra block padding (top and bottom padding) for this. should be avoided here except in rare cases. The same rules apply for the site’s and , though it’s also common for these elements to appear full-width rather than content-width. Automatic.css is designed with these best practices in mind. Default Section Padding​ Make sure you read about Section Spacing Setup. Also note that “M” section spacing is added to top level section elements by default. This can easily be overridden on a per-section basis using Section Padding Classes. Section Padding Classes​ It’s common to need to adjust the block padding in sections to create more or less white space. Knowing this, we’ve created utility classes specifically for doing this. The naming convention for these classes is . All of the typical t-shirt sizes are available (XS to XXL) Section padding classes are unique in that they don’t apply padding equally to all sides. They’re designed to maintain a consistent inline gutter while only adjusting the section’s block padding. It should be noted that ACSS is one of the only frameworks to offer a utility like this. Other frameworks require you to use separate padding-top and padding-bottom classes that are not specifically related to sections. Not only does this require you to use extra classes on each section, but it also creates a disconnect, making it impossible for you to tighten or loosen your section spacing globally. Section Spacing & Pro Mode​ Since section padding classes are so important and useful and unique to each section, they stay active when Pro Mode is activated. They’re an example of a utility class that we still recommend using even when Pro Mode is active. “Tweener” Sizes​ It can be common to want an in-between size on occasion.

Automatic.css controls section spacing by default while giving you the ability to adjust it as needed per the design. Anatomy of a Section​ There’s a great article on section structure in web design that you should read if you really want to understand the importance of sections. ACSS follows this basic section structure by default. Section Spacing Defaults​ Block padding (top and bottom) and inline padding (left and right) are both controlled via the dashboard: Section Spacing in ACSS Section spacing uses the Base Spacing values from the regular spacing system and multiplies them to make them bigger and more appropriate for sections. The amount it’s multiplied by is set via the Base Spacing Multiplier input. You can choose whatever values you want for the multiplier. The first number is how much it’s multiplied on mobile and the second number is how much it’s multiplied on desktop. The multiplication is actually fluid between those two numbers, so there are no breakpoints involved. The “Gutter” inputs let you set the inline padding (left and right) via a responsive clamp function, and the “Block Padding” input is where you set the block padding (top and bottom) via a section spacing variable. Note: The “Block Padding” input accepts two values. If only one value is given, it’ll be used for both the top and bottom value. If two values are given, the first value is used for the top and the second value is used for the bottom (it’s not recommended you touch this unless you know exactly what you’re doing and why you’re doing it). All of the inputs in this section map directly to the “M” (medium) section spacing value. Other section spacing sizes are generated using the Spacing Scale from the regular spacing system.

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageSmart Spacing is a feature unique to Automatic.css and is easily one of the most impactful features in the framework as it helps you achieve even spacing within containers on the pages you’re building while simultaneously applying automatic spacing for rich text content, blog posts, and other content with limited styling controls. How Smart Spacing works​ It’s common in modern web design to want even spacing between elements in a container. The most common method for achieving this is with the property. Unfortunately, even spacing with can be difficult to achieve because certain elements, like headings, paragraphs, lists, and list items, often have default margins added by either the page builder or the user agent stylesheet. The result is an even gap between elements but an unbalanced result thanks to the default margins. Smart Spacing removes the default margin from headings, paragraphs, lists, and list items, allowing you to use to space your content evenly. This gives you full control over your spacing in every container as well as the ability to achieve perfectly even spacing. But, that’s not all that Smart Spacing does. Once the default spacing is removed, Smart Spacing then decides where the default spacing should *actually* be applied (rather than applying it to all these elements by default) and uses your preferred spacing values to do it (via the ACSS dashboard). Here’s a rundown of where Smart Spacing values are applied: Content within rich text elements Content within blog post content (via the post content element in the builder) Content within a container with the class Content within a container targeted by the “Target Additional Selectors” input Woocommerce element content Furthermore, when the default spacing is re-applied, it’s only applied to matching elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, and list items) that have adjacent siblings. This ensures that spacing is only applied when needed and that extra spacing above a first child or below a last child never occurs. One huge benefit of Smart Spacing is that you can space blog post content without custom CSS. Most page builders have a “post content” element that pulls in content from the Gutenberg editor, but these modules rarely have individualized controls for heading, paragraph, list, and list item spacing. With Smart Spacing, you have automatic control over the spacing of these elements from the ACSS dashboard. How to use Smart Spacing​ Smart Spacing Panel First, turn on Smart Spacing in the Spacing > Smart Spacing dashboard. Next, use within your typical page-building workflow to space out the content throughout your page evenly. Remember, your parent container needs to be set to Flex or Grid. Flex column is the most common approach. That’s it! Smart spacing will zero out all default spacing so you can use gaps for page building and it’ll add intelligent spacing back to the areas specified earlier in this doc. Paragraph & List Spacing​ A powerful benefit of Smart Spacing is the ability to control list spacing without writing custom CSS. Click on the “Text and Lists” tab to access the settings: Paragraph and List Spacing You can set spacing for paragraphs, lists, list items, nested lists and list items, and list indentation. Keep in mind that any input that says “(block)” accepts two values if desired. The first value would be the top value and the second value would be the bottom value. Other Spacing​ Smart Spacing does more than text, lists, and headings. Click on the “Other” tab: Smart Spacing Other Tab Here’s an overview of your options: Flow Spacing: This is a “catch-all” spacing that applies smart spacing to any element not specifically identified. For example, if someone throws in a random div with content in it, flow spacing will be applied to that div to ensure that no elements are awkwardly unspaced. Figures: This allows you to space figure and picture elements. Figcaptions: This allows you to space out captions on figure elements. Blockquotes: This controls spacing around block quotes. Notice that some of these, by default, simply reference your existing . Why Isn’t Smart Spacing Applied to XYZ area?​ To avoid being too heavy-handed, Smart Spacing is only applied to direct children of the target elements. If your layout has extra wrappers, it can interfere with the Smart Spacing Targeting. For example, here’s a situation where Smart Spacing will be applied properly: Since the children are direct children of the div that’s being targeted by Smart Spacing, you’ll see the correct spacing. But if the structure is similar to the structure below, Smart Spacing won’t work: For whatever reason, this layout has an extra wrapper around the children. That wrapper will stop smart spacing from being applied. There are two ways to fix this: The utility class​ If there’s ever a situation where smart spacing is not automatically applying adjacent-sibling margins where you think it’s supposed to (situations where you aren’t using gap), add the utility class. As we discussed above, this class must be placed on the direct parent of the children you want to space out. In situations where you don’t have physical access to add this class to the proper element, you should use the following technique: Targeting Additional Selectors (Custom Smart Spacing Areas)​ Smart Spacing Additional Selectors Let’s return to our previous example. We had a structure with an extra wrapper and the builder/shortcode/code block, etc. is not giving us physical access to use a utility class. In this case, we’d want to grab the most appropriate selector and add it to ACSS’ “Target Additional Selectors” input. For the example above, you could do this two ways: The first selector just targets the selector. This will apply smart spacing to all elements. The second selector targets all divs that are a direct child of . There’s no real right or wrong here, it just depends on the context, situation, and what you’re trying to achieve. All you need to know is that all selectors must be wrapped in quotes, and comma separated in the input field. Avoiding Duplicate Margins​ Since certain elements like figures, blockquotes, and lists have block spacing applied (top and bottom), this can result in duplicate margins. In this situation, the top margin of the next element combines with the bottom margin of the elements I just listed. This is obviously undesirable. By default, Smart Spacing is programmed to remove these duplicate margins, but we do so in a way that’s visible and controllable by the user. “Avoid Duplicate Margins” allows you to see and manipulate the exact selectors where duplicate margins are being removed. Feel free to add or remove selectors as needed. Smart Spacing Variables​ There are some cases where you might want to manually reference a smart spacing value. The following tokens are available for this: Selectively Disabling Smart Spacing​ You can selectively disable smart spacing using the utility class. This can be applied at the box level, section level, or even the page/template level. Remember, doing this will remove ALL spacing, which assumes you’ll be using gaps to control spacing as the alternative approach.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageSpacing variables allow you to hook into the ACSS spacing system for establishing consistent, responsive spacing for things like margins, padding, and gaps. The most important thing to wrap your head around is that spacing is spacing. Unlike with classes, which have to declare what they’re applying spacing to (e.g. margin-top), spacing variables are just pure spacing values. They can be used anywhere, so they don’t require specific names. For example, let’s say you want to apply padding to a testimonial card you’re creating. Since this is a re-usable element, you’re creating a BEM class for it called and assigning all styles to the custom class instead of using utility classes. Here’s what that would look like: Notice there is no variable. Once again, spacing is just spacing and variables are just values. You could use the same value to gap the card’s content out: The only exception here would be contextual variables. This makes life super easy when styling custom classes. There are very few variables to know and they’re super easy to use without a lot of decision-making. Section Spacing & Footer Spacing​ Sections and footers typically demand much more spacing than other boxes. If you’re creating a custom class for section padding or using a variable at the ID level on a particular section or within your footer, we recommend using ACSS’s section spacing variables instead of regular spacing variables. This also keeps things contextually accurate. Fine Tuning Spacing with ​ When using variables, you’re not limited to the available t-shirt sizes by default. You can achieve any value in between each size by using a spacing variable within a function. Let’s say that was *almost* perfect, but you want just a little less spacing. It’s easy! This calculation reduces the padding value by 10%. Dividing will reduce the value and multiplying will amplify it. Using decimals will give you fine-tuning control. The only thing to potentially keep in mind here is your website’s spacing scale: ACSS Spacing Scale The value for your scale will help you decide whether you should multiply or divide. If my scale is 1.5, then the halfway point between sizes is 1.25. This means that my logical adjustment range for each size is up to 1.25 down or up from the size I chose. Anything adjustment beyond that means I should probably base my sizing off the next size up or down (from “m,” that would mean switching to “s” or “l.”). While this isn’t a requirement (nothing will break if you ignore this suggestion), it keeps things logically consistent. The below styling makes objectively zero sense: The value of this calc exactly matches the value of , so should be used instead. Even 1.4 wouldn’t make much sense because you’re getting too far away from the initial value. It would be more logical to do than to do . The principle is to keep the adjustments as small as possible. Using spacing variables to move elements a known amount​ Spacing variables also come in handy when you need to shift an elements position, either with absolute positioning, relative positioning, fixed positioning, or negative margin. Let’s say I want to make an image overlap with the section above it. For that to happen, it needs to travel a distance equal to the top padding of the section it’s in, plus the amount of whatever overlap you want. Not only that, but we probably want to add some bottom padding to the section being overlapped to ensure the white space stays consistent. Using variables for all of this makes this super easy, consistent, and maintainable. Creating the overlap​ To make the image overlap the section above it, we need to use negative margin. The value is the sum of the section padding plus overlap: is the known value for the section’s block padding, so we take that and then add to it (that’s the amount of overlap we want). Lastly, we multiply that by “-1” to make these values negative. With the overlap achieved, we then want to adjust the bottom padding of the section being overlapped. How much do we adjust it by? The exact opposite of the overlap we just created: See, there are no random “magic numbers” to manage. It’s all done with variables, removing a lot of thinking and keeping things super clean. Variables Are King​ Variables are much more powerful than utility classes because they can be fine-tuned and they can be attached to custom classes for maximum scalability and maintainability. This is why we advocate for a Pro Mode approach to development where utility classes are used sparingly and most of the work is done with custom classes and variables.",

To get started, navigate to the Spacing area of the dashboard: ACSS Dashboard Standard Spacing Values​ Standard Spacing Standard Spacing asks for a Base Spacing value and a Spacing Scale value. Base Spacing is the spacing value that controls all spacing across the website. It’s directly mapped to all “M” (medium) spacing values and affects section spacing values as well. The desktop value will be the exact value of your base spacing at content width and beyond, the mobile value will be the exact value at your website’s minimum width, and the degree of difference between these values will control how aggressively spacing scales from desktop to mobile. Spacing Scale is the math scale used to generate additional sizes above and below “M.” Sizes above “M” are multiplied by the scale value and sizes below “M” are divided by the scale value. The desktop value controls how much variance there is between sizes near content-width and the mobile value controls the degree of variance between sizes toward the minimum website width. This allows you to scale spacing sizes more aggressively on desktop and more conservatively on mobile. Tip: If you want to make all spacing bigger or smaller, adjust the base value. If you only want to change the degree of spacing between different spacing sizes, adjust the scale. If you want to tweak both, tweak both. What Standard Spacing Affects​ Standard spacing affects the following: Spacing Variables Section Spacing Variables Padding Classes Margin Classes Gap Classes Contextual Spacing Utilities Header Classes You can adjust standard spacing at any time, even after a website is completely built.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageUsers can create custom textures and overlays in Automatic.css using a unique approach that allows for a texture to be used as a background, overlay, or both. What are textures?​ Web designers are typically working with solid colors, or they’re working with image files and gradients for backgrounds and overlays. Often, it’s a mix of both. ACSS has provided tons of solid background and overlay options since inception, but you still need a way to define areas of “texture.” In Automatic.css, a Texture is any background or overlay that requires a re-usable image file, repeating pattern, or gradient. By creating a texture that’s available globally, you can easily apply your texture to select areas of your site using a simple utility class. Activating Textures & Overlays​ To create custom textures, you first need to activate the Textures & Overlays feature by navigating to Backgrounds & Text > Options > Textures & Overlays: Textures & Overlays Option Once you enable this option, a new “Textures & Overlays” accordion will appear above Options. Creating Your First Texture​ Textures & Overlays Panel The Textures & Overlays panel can be a bit intimidating at first glance. Don’t worry, though, it’s fairly easy to dial in the exact effect you’re going for. Here is an explanation of each property: Name: (Optional) A custom name for your texture. This will generate extra utility classes: and . By default, you’ll have and and these options will always be available to you even if you opt for a custom name (assuming the overlay option is enabled on the texture for classes). Background Color: Background color is rarely seen when using textures and overlays unless your Texture Asset is transparent or the Texture Asset fails to load (background color is used as a fallback). Set this to generally match the color of your texture/effect. Texture Asset: The file or gradient for your texture. And yes, this field supports compound assets. If your texture is file-based, using the raw, relative URL is recommended. Asset is URL: If your asset is a url, enable this option. We’ll automatically wrap your asset in . Texture Overlay: You can add a local overlay color or gradient to your texture, but it must be done with a because we use a new border-image technique which doesn’t require pseudo elements. If you want a solid overlay, just make the two gradient values the same. Texture Size: The dimensions of the asset. Accepts any valid background-size value. Texture Position: The position of the texture within its box. Accepts keywords, static values, and relative values. Attachment: Choose whether the texture should behave normally () or act as parallax (). Repeat: Choose to have your pattern or . Other repeat-related keywords are applicable as well. Color Relationship: Textures are compatible with ACSS auto color relationships, allowing you to sync foreground styles wherever your texture is used. Enable Overlay Class: If you want to be able to use your texture as a pseudo-element overlay in addition to the background effect, enable this option. Additional Overlay Layer: Your overlay can have an overlay! This uses the same border-image technique from above, so make sure you use a . Blend Mode: Set a blend mode for your overlay (optional). Overlay Opacity: Set an opacity for your overlay. Using Your Texture​ If you want to use your texture as a background effect, add the utility class to any area you want to see your texture in the background. If you want to use your texture as an overlay effect, add the utility class to any areas you want to see your texture in overlay. Note: The .overlay- classes will also work on images as long as your image is wrapped in a or tag. Tweaking Textures on The Fly (Texture Variables)​ Textures and Overlays use variables that can be overwritten at any time at the page level, template level, or box level. This allows you to start with your global texture while easily making any tweaks and adjustments in specific areas. Here are the target variables that can have new values assigned at any time. We recommend tweaking this with your own modifier classes () or at the ID level if it’s a true one-off tweak: For Background Textures​ For Overlay Textures​ (the local overlay via ) Quirks & Workarounds​ As with everything in CSS, the techniques used to achieve one effect can create roadblocks for other effects. This is especially true with something as complex as background textures and overlays. As long as you know about the quirks, you can work around them. Here are some things to be aware of: If you are using the local overlay effect for Textures with the classes, you won’t be able to use the border property. This is because the local overlay uses to accomplish the overlay (to avoid the use of pseudo elements and additional complexity). If you must be able to put borders on the same box as your texture, you need to make sure you’ve enabled the Overlay Mode option and configure your overlay to look exactly like your background texture. Overlay mode uses a pseudo element and will free up the border property on your original box. For overlays, if the element you’re wanting to add an overlay to already uses pseudo elements for something else, you won’t be able to add your overlay effect (or it’ll replace the existing pseudo element). This is because elements can only have a single and a single . You can get around this by adding an additional wrapper to your structure, will give you two additional pseudo elements. Textures & Overlays is a very powerful feature in Automatic.css and is implemented in a uniquely exceptional way that allows for textures to be used as either backgrounds or overlays while mapping to auto color relationships. No other framework in existence has the feature. Enjoy.",

All: Text Transform: Set default text-transform for all headings or text sizes. All: Text Wrap: Set default text-wrap for all headings or text sizes.*** * Default line-height (Smart Line Height)​ ACSS uses what we call “Smart Line Height” as a default value for all headings and text. Rather than using standard values like “1.1” or “1.5,” Smart Line Height uses a formula based on a desired leading value which is then added to double the x-height of the typeface. Smart Line Height scales more accurately across various typefaces and font-sizes and is especially awesome for fluid responsive typography. It’s also more efficient, since you don’t have to set a value for every heading and text size – it looks good across the board automatically. If you want to adjust this line-height value, we recommend changing the value inside the function in decimal increments. Of course, you can use whatever value you want, but Smart Line Height is pretty awesome. ** Default max-width​ Setting a max on the width of lines is important for maintaining proper readability on a website. Unfortunately, due to Bricks’ application of max-width defaults, there’s no way for us to apply max-widths on headings and text without breakage. Therefore, this option is not applied in Bricks. *** Default text-wrap​ The default value of “pretty” automatically prevents typography orphans on your website. The other option is “balance” which balances headings, but doesn’t work on text that’s more than 4 lines. Balance is a little heavy-handed, which is why the default is “pretty.” If you want to turn this feature off, set the value to “wrap.” Setting Defaults for Individual Heading & Text Sizes​ Every heading and text level has a defaults panel so you can set defaults granularly.

All heading sizes are automatically responsive, and unlike with other frameworks, heading sizes in Automatic.css follow a perfect mathematical scale. Fluid Heading Setup​ To access settings for your headings, navigate to Typography > Headings in the dashboard. ACSS Base Heading Settings To start, set a base font size for your headings. The “base” font size serves two purposes: It sets the default size of H4 headings on desktop. It sets the starting point for the mathematical typography scale (for other sizes) Typically, your base heading size should be slightly larger than your base text size. For example, if base text size is set to 18px, you can set your base heading size to 20px. Heading Type Scale​ The second most crucial thing to customize within Automatic.css is the headings scale. The scale controls the degree of variance between heading sizes. You can choose from popular typography scales (use the up/down arrows on your keyboard in the scale inputs) or set your scale manually. It’s common to want to use a tighter scale on mobile devices than on desktop since mobile devices don’t have enough room to fit more extreme scales. If you don’t want the scale to change between devices, make the Typography Scale and Mobile Typography Scale equal (double-check that the scale you’ve chosen works well on all devices). Note: To generate a hierarchy, the scale values must be greater than 1. Fluid Heading Overrides​ You can manually override heading sizes in Automatic.css. When you override a size, you’re effectively removing it from the mathematical scale. No sizes above or below the size you’ve overridden will be affected. To override a heading size, click the heading level you’d like to target from within the tabs in the Typography > Headings area. ACSS Heading Size Override You’ll find the inputs to override that heading size toward the bottom of the list of inputs. To override a size, input a value into the mobile or desktop field. You can override the max without overriding the min and vice versa. If an override value is not specified, ACSS will just use the default value. H5 & H6 Minimums​ Because you have complete control over the type scale, creating a hierarchy where “S” and “XS” text sizes are too small and inaccessible for most users is possible. As a protection, you can use the “min” fields in the text overrides for these sizes to set fixed minimums that “S” and “XS” will never go below. We do this for you by default out of the box, but you can adjust it if you’d like. Heading Minimum Size How do I dial in the proper font sizes?​ The primary values controlling font sizes in Automatic are the base and scale values. The Base sizes allow you to adjust ALL SIZES EVENLY. The Scales allow you to adjust the VARIANCE between sizes (larger scales create a larger variance, and smaller scales create more minor variance).

All text sizes are automatically responsive, and unlike with other frameworks, text sizes in Automatic.css follow a perfect mathematical scale. Root Font Size​ The first setting in the Typography tab is for Root Font Size. It’s essential to set the root font size as a percentage for maximum accessibility. Typography Panel for Root Font Size The most common root font sizes are 100% and 62.5%. In Automatic.css, the default is 100% because that’s the typical standard. 62.5% makes it easier to calculate rem values (1rem = 10px), but ACSS has Auto Rem Conversion to help with that, so setting root font size to 62.5% is not necessary. Fluid Text Setup​ Next, you’re asked to set your base font size for fluid text. The “base” font size serves two purposes: It sets the default size of paragraph text on desktop. It sets the starting point for the mathematical typography scale (for other sizes) _While these values are stated in pixel units, they’re converted to rem on the back end. Automatic.css uses rem, em, and dynamic units exclusively._The “S” and “XS” sizes are scaled *down* from the “M” size while all the other sizes are scaled up. Fluid Text Scale​ The second most crucial thing to customize within Automatic.css is the typography scale. This scale controls the degree of variance between text sizes. You can choose from popular typography scales or set your own scale manually. It’s common to want to use a tighter scale on mobile devices than on desktop since mobile devices don’t have enough room to fit more extreme scales, so Automatic.css lets you set the desktop and mobile scales independently. If you don’t want the scale to change between devices, make the Typography Scale and Mobile Typography Scale equal (double-check that the scale you’ve chosen works well on all devices).

When you override a size, you’re effectively removing it from the mathematical scale. No sizes above or below the size you’ve overridden will be affected. Font Size Override To override a size, input a value into the min and max field. The min field controls the bottom end of the fluid range. The max field controls the top (desktop) end of the range. These values are plugged into the clamp() and calc() functions to ensure these custom sizes are automatically responsive.

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageA unique feature of Automatic.css that you probably won’t see in other frameworks (unless they follow suit) is the ability to set text and heading line length caps. The line length of content – the number of characters per line of text – is one of the most critical aspects of quality UX design on the web. Amateur web designers are notorious for creating content that is too wide visually. Why line length is important​ Optimal Line Length Chart from Baymard Text content that is too wide forces the user’s eyes to scan too far left and right. Numerous tests and studies have shown that this makes text content “intimidating” and overwhelming. Additionally, line length influences reading comprehension and reading motivation. In copywriting, you’re taught that the job of the first sentence is to get the person to read the second sentence, and so on. If you’re going to put effort into your copy to motivate the reader in that fashion, you shouldn’t then de-motivate them with a physical design error. Reader motivation spikes every time the reader gets to a new line of text. Just think about reading a book. New lines spike motivation, just as turning the page spikes motivation. Motivation drops as pages get longer and as lines get longer. So, too, does focus, which affects comprehension. The result is that wide text content has far lower readability and worse comprehension. And since we presumably want the user to read and comprehend our content, we should prevent this. The optimal line length of text​ Proper line length is typically expressed with a specific character count. Research shows that the optimal line length of the body text on the web is between 50 and 60 characters. That assumes your text is between 16px and 20px. The tricky thing about text line length is that the optimal character count changes as text gets bigger. To complicate matters further, not all characters are the same width. So a good character count with one typeface may not be acceptable with a different typeface. There’s really no need to overthink it, though. All you need to know is that text that’s too wide is hard to read, so you should put caps on line length that prevent text from getting too wide. Layout-based line length caps​ Have you noticed that certain types of layouts are very popular on the web? Take a common layout like this as an example: Frames Hero Alpha Layout Example This isn’t an accident. Websites are too wide for most text content, so good UX designers use visuals and other techniques to put natural line-length caps on text. When the heading and lede paragraph are contained in that left column, they’re easier to read. A user can quickly digest that content without scanning all the way from left to right. In this scenario, we don’t have to worry about the number of characters per line. The section layout naturally caps the length of each line. CSS-based line length caps​ Some layouts don’t naturally cap line length. When this is the case, we need to cap line length with CSS. We do this by setting a max-width using “ch” units. The “ch” stands for “character” and it’s a way to control width based on the standard width of a “0” character at a given font size. It’s not exact, but it’s more or less accurate. We use because we only want the cap to take effect if the line length happens to reach that cap. If the line length is shorter than the max, that’s fine too. This is all handled for you by ACSS. How to set a max line length in ACSS​ Line length is controlled via the Typography panel in ACSS. You can set a maximum line length for every text size and every heading size: ACSS Line Length Settings Line length is not set by default, so the inputs are blank out of the box. Put a “ch” value into the input field for each text size to set a line length. The input accepts any unit, so you need to explicitly write the full ch value, e.g. . This will automatically affect all paragraphs, list content, and anything that uses a text size class, such as . You can repeat the same process for headings. Setting your line lengths properly will ensure that all text content on your site is maximized for readability and comprehension.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageAll the typography properties you define in the ACSS dashboard are available as variables. This is extremely handy for two types of scenarios: When you want to reference them on an element they wouldn’t apply to by default (i.e. you want to make sure a specific page element uses the same font family as your headings) When you want to override one of those properties in a specific context (i.e. you want a specific page section to use a different heading style, while still being attached to the framework in all other aspects) The following typography variables can be accessed or changed at any time with custom styling: The font size variables correspond to ACSS’s global typography system heading sizes and text sizes: The following variables are declared globally for all heading levels: (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (available by default) (available by default) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (available by default) If you choose to override your global heading properties on specific heading levels in the ACSS dashboard, the corresponding variables will be available.

(if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (available by default) Note: specific heading levels have a variable for the max-width property, which isn’t available globally. The following variables are declared globally for text across the site: (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (available by default) (available by default) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (available by default) If you choose to override your global text properties on specific text sizes in the ACSS dashboard, the corresponding variables will be available. Here are those variables for the “XL” text size, but the same logic applies to other text sizes. (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (if declared in the dashboard settings) (available by default) Examples of using typography variables​ Referencing a heading size​ Let’s say we want to use a level 2 heading (), but with a font size only as tall as our regular level 4 headings () — this happens in situations where semantic HTML and accessibility dictate we need to use an , but the design calls for a smaller size. We could create a custom class, and reference the variable as the font-size value: Now apply that class on your heading, and you have a heading element that is only as tall as an heading, but keeps its semantic meaning. This technique is demonstrated in the video dedicated to Typography in the ACSS 101 course, starting at 11:59: ACSS 101.03: Fluid Responsive, Scale-Based Typography - YouTube Referencing the headings font family​ Let’s say we want to create a custom component that needs to use our headings font family despite not being a heading (this doesn’t happen in every project, but could come in handy). While we could reference our font family statically, that’s not always handy, and it‘s not very maintainable: what happens if we were to change typefaces in the future? We’re not interested in the component using this specific font, we just want it to use what the headings typeface happens to be. It would be much better to be able to keep it in sync with the headings, rather than statically reference the font family. Easy peasy, create a custom class, and reference the variable as the font-family value: Creating a very custom heading style (advanced usage)​ Let’s say we want to create a special heading style that needs to look extra fancy. It will seldom be used on the site, just for a few special headings related to a extremely high-end offer our client wants to run. Think handwritten, luxurious, ever-so-slightly over the top. To achieve that, we could create a class, and use the variables in multiple ways: We’re going to redefine some of our heading variables in the context of our class (to define a handwritten font family and other properties that won’t be used for headings elsewhere on the site). We’re also going to reference our variable as the font size, to make sure those headings are always extremely noticeable. By proceeding this way, we can create a completely custom heading style, while still being tied into the framework.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageAuto-BEM revolutionizes the way users add custom classes in page builders. This feature automatically adds a custom class to a parent and all its children in two clicks using BEM methodology for proper organization and maintainability. The class names are derived from the element name in the structure panel but can quickly and easily be overridden during the class creation process. That’s not all, though! Keep reading for a full breakdown of all features. Activating Auto-BEM Functionality​ To use Auto-BEM in a supported page builder, first activate it from the ACSS dashboard: Once it’s activated and you save changes, you can open the builder. The Auto-BEM feature will show up in the structure panel. The “BEM” indicator may be slightly different depending on the builder you’re using, but look for a “BEM” label on any parent element. Creating BEM Classes​ The primary use of this feature is to create BEM classes for the parent element and all its children. As an example, let’s say we have a “service card” with two internal wrappers and elements within those. Without Auto-BEM, you have to manually select every element one by one and type the class name with the BEM extensions. With Auto-BEM enabled, you have two options: Double-click the “BEM” badge to apply BEM classes to all elements instantly. Single-click the “BEM” badge to open the Auto-BEM panel. If you single-click the BEM badge, here’s what you’ll see: A positionable panel appears, showing you the parent element and all of its children with proper nesting structure. By default, the class names are mapped to the names of the elements in the structure panel. If you need to make changes to the class names, you can click any class name directly in the Auto-BEM panel and edit it. If you want to sync this edit back to the structure panel, enable the “Sync Labels” toggle. When you’re ready to apply the classes to the elements, click “Apply Classes.” Now you’re all set to begin styling! Excluding Elements From Auto-BEM​ There might be cases where you want to exclude an element or group of elements from getting Auto-BEM classes. This is easy to do by hovering over the element in the Auto-BEM panel and clicking the “X” icon. Now, all elements will receive classes except the excluded elements. Excluding Words From Auto-BEM​ There could be times when you want a small note in the structure panel, but you don’t want this text applied to classes when using Auto-BEM. For example, some users write “(CSS)” to denote that an element has custom CSS. For this reason, any text wrapped in “()” or “[]” will be ignored by Auto-BEM. Existing Class Handling​ If a parent and its children already have BEM classes when you click the BEM badge, a common case for Frames users or users of other layout and block packs, Auto-BEM will automatically detect this and present you with options for handling the existing classes. Options include: “Rename” — Will simply rename the classes in the database while retaining all existing styles (Note: Renaming classes is not possible in Oxygen). “Create New & Remove Old” – Creates new BEM classes and removes the old ones from elements (includes the option to copy styles to the new classes) “Create New & Delete Old” – Creates new BEM classes and deletes the old ones from the database (includes the option to copy styles to the new classes) “Create New & Keep Old” – Creates new BEM classes and leaves the old ones in place (includes the option to copy styles to the new classes) Frames users can now preserve all frames in their default state without losing BEM functionality and without having to create and delete classes manually. Important Note: You will only see the above handling options when clicking the BEM button on “blocks” that have “element” children. If the only direct child of a block is another block, you won’t see these handling options. We can’t auto-BEM elements that don’t exist, so it’s important to make sure you’re selecting a block that actually has element children. We hope you love this new feature as much as we do, and we’re excited to bring even more functionality and efficiency to this process.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageIn most scenarios, modern web design calls for using relative units over static units (pixels). One of the most common and useful relative units is the unit. As explained in the below video, rem units map directly to the root font size of the website. In most cases, the root font size is 100%, and rendered by most browsers as 16px. PB101: L05 - Static vs Relative Units - YouTube The challenge with using rem units is that they’re hard to calculate on the fly if you use pixels as a reference point. For example, if you need 60px of spacing, how many rems is that? It’s 60 divided by 16, which equals 3.75rem. Many people can do that math on the fly, but what happens when dealing with decimals? 64.5px is 4.03125rem. That’s not math that most people can do in their heads. And since time is money, breaking out a calculator every two minutes to calculate rem units is out of the question. Enter ACSS’ Pixel to Rem Auto-Conversion (ctr) feature. When entering values in builder input fields, you can type the pixel value you want and add “ctr” as the unit. When you use “ctr” and press enter, Automatic.css will automatically swap the pixel value for the correct rem value. And yes, it does this based on your website’s root font size, whether you’ve chosen 100%, 62.5%, or anything else. What about custom CSS?​ Good news! The same auto-conversion works in custom CSS when using the builder’s CSS areas in the builder canvas. The semicolon will trigger the conversion rather than the return key. If the ctr is used prior to the end of the line, it’s okay – the conversion will still take place as soon as you add the semicolon on the end of the line. What about custom CSS outside of the builder?​ While we can’t run the auto-converter in every tool that’s ever been built for adding CSS to a website, we do offer a new ctr() function. So, any tool that allows you to write SCSS and hook into Automatic.css, like WPCodeBox, will allow you to use the auto-converter when writing your custom CSS.",

    "content": "Version: 3.xOn this pageAutomatic.css is managed from a Real-Time Dashboard – available in the builder or on the front-end – that features Instant Preview and Hot Reload and various other enhancements. Opening the Dashboard​ The dashboard is available in the builder or on the front-end via both a clickable element as well as a keyboard shortcut. You can also quick-open to specific areas of the dashboard with additional keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard Shortcuts​ The most convenient way to open the dashboard is with one of many keyboard shortcuts. You can manage these shortcuts in Options > User Shortcuts. The default shortcut for opening the dashboard is . Alternative you can quick open to these areas: Custom SCSS: Typography: Spacing: You can save changes with , force save changes with , and pin the dashboard with . To record your own keyboard shortcut for any of these, simply click the pencil icon to the right of the input and then press and hold the desired key combination. Click to Open​ To ensure the highest degree of accessibility, there’s at least one click trigger to open the dashboard at all times. The existence of the admin bar on any given page will determine which trigger you see. WP-Admin Bar Trigger​ When the wp-admin bar is available on the page, the click trigger for the ACSS dashboard is the Automatic.css link in the admin bar. Click this link and dashboard will open. Clicking again will close it. Floating Canvas Trigger​ When the wp-admin bar is not active on the page, you will see a floating icon on the canvas. This icon will open and close the dashboard when clicked. Dashboard Organization & Instant Search​ The dashboard is organized into specific areas of the framework, but also features instant search which will expose all features and settings related to your search phrase. While ACSS is a very robust tool, the dashboard is designed so that almost every setting is less than three clicks away. Instant Preview​ As you change and adjust settings in the ACSS dashboard, you can see the effect of those changes on the canvas in real time. This works whether you’re in the builder or on the front-end. It should be noted that Instant Preview is not compatible with every single input in the dashboard, though well over 97% of inputs are compatible. If you are changing an input and you don’t see the changes happening in real time, you’re advised to save the change, close the dashboard, and reload the page. While live preview is very accurate in almost all cases, it’s accomplished with injected inline styles and is not a reflection of the actual enqueued stylesheet until you save and refresh. NoteFor greatest accuracy in seeing what the stylesheet is doing, you should reload the page with the dashboard closed. When the dashboard is open, live preview can influence what you’re seeing. WarningCustom SCSS is currently incompatible with Instant Preview when using SCSS mixins or functions. We’re working on making the SCSS processor compatible with Instant Preview. Hot Reload​ When you save changes in the ACSS dashboard, there’s usually no need to manually refresh the page. ACSS’ hot reload feature will instantly reload the stylesheet, showing you the newest version of the site. In the small number of cases where there’s a discrepancy between what you’re seeing and what you think you should be seeing, close the dashboard and attempt to hard refresh the page manually. Change Notice​ A colored icon in the header lets you know whether the dashboard is in sync with the stylesheet or if there are changes that need to be saved: Green circle: Stylesheet is in sync. No changes need to be saved ( can force a save here). Yellow circle with an extra ring: Changes have been made and will be lost if you reload or leave the page without saving. When the yellow dot is present, you’ll also receive a browser warning when trying to leave the page without saving. Input Interactions​ There are a number of things you should know about the ACSS dashboard when you’re interacting with it. Here are some tips: You can arrow up/down in number fields to increase or decrease the increment value. You can shift + arrow to increase whole numbers in cases where the input is increasing the decimal. You can arrow up/down through variable families. If the input has an ACSS variable as its value, you can arrow up/down through related variables. For example, if you have –text-m as a value, arrow up/down will cycle through the remaining t-shirt sizes. Color values will produce a swatch preview. If you put a valid color value in an ACSS input, the input will produce a swatch representation of your color. ACSS auto-wraps functions. Writing over and over again is not required. Just type double dash and the name of your variable. ACSS will handle the var functions on the backend. If an input has more than one in it, you’ll see the just for clarity. If there’s only one var(), ACSS will strip it to keep the input as clean as possible. Auto-calc. You don’t have to write when doing a formula. Just write the formula and ACSS will auto-wrap it in . Hover Styles​ Inputs that allow you to set a hover style will have a small cursor icon next to them. Clicking the cursor will swap to the hover style input for that property. Clicking the icon again will swap back to the non-hover input. When the icon is illuminated, you’re looking at the hover value. When it’s grey, you’re looking at the non-hover value. Palette Configuration​ All colors are configured the same way. Start by pasting or typing your hex code into the hex input or selecting a color with the color picker. ACSS will calculate the HSL values and automatically configure all shades for that color. You can customize each individual shade by clicking on its swatch in the top row next to the color’s main swatch and adjusting the HSL values. The shades are listed in order from lightest to darkest, with “hover” being the final swatch. Remember, “hover” is a color shade in ACSS for each color. You’re not setting a specific hover style on anything here – it’s simply a shade you configure and use for hovers of that color when needed. When adjusting shades, you’re mainly going to be changing the lightness value. Next important would be adjustments to saturation. Rarely will you change the hue and only by a few degrees max. Below the color configuration area are your settings for controlling which transparencies are loaded and available and whether or not you’re going to include color scheme support for that color. Alternate Color / Color Scheme Support​ When you activate “Alternate Color” for any given color, a new “Alt” tab will appear above the swatches area. Clicking the tab will reveal all the settings for the Alt color and its shades. Configure this alternate color however you’d like. Cheatsheet​ A full cheatsheet of all ACSS class, variables, and recipes is available in the dashboard. From the home screen, select “Cheatsheet.” You can also copy to clipboard from here.",

This is right-click menu that gives you quick access to classes and variables with live preview. Using the context menu in your workflow will speed up your development exponentially. Enabling the Context Menu​ The context menu is enabled by default, but you can check its status by going to Options > Workflow Enhancements. Supported Builders​ The context menu is a feature that our team must integrate with each supported builder separately. Make sure you’re using an officially supported builder before attempting to use the context menu. Adding Classes With the Context Menu​ The context menu is great for adding utility classes. Simple right click on the class input field in the builder to access the menu. The fastest way to add a utility class from the context menu is to search for it by part of its name. For example, you can search for “grid” and the context menu will instantly show you all grid classes. If you hover over the classes in the context menu, the canvas will live preview the effect that class will have if you were to add it. If you click the class, ACSS will attach the class to the element. If you click the class again without closing the context menu, ACSS will remove it. You can add/remove as many utility classes as you want without having to close and re-open the context menu. Adding Variables with the Context Menu​ You can use the context menu to add variables by right clicking a CSS input field in the builder. In these situations, the context menu intelligently recommends the most appropriate variables for the specific type of input you clicked on. Hovering over a variable will live preview its effect on the canvas. Clicking a variable will place it as the value of the input. Clicking it again will remove it from the input. Click a different variable will replace the value. Choosing Colors in the Context Menu​ When you’re interacting with color-based utilities, whether classes or variables, you will see a swatch layout. The context menu knows which colors are enabled or disabled on your install and will only show you available options. If you don’t see a color option, it’s because the color is disabled. You’ll need to enable the color in your ACSS palette settings and then reload the builder in order to see it. The important thing to note here is that you also have access to all transparencies. Colors that support transparencies will have a small arrow below their swatch. You can access transparencies for any color/shade by holding CMD or CNTRL while hovering over the swatch. Positioning in the Context Menu​ The context menu appears immediately below the input by default, but you’re free to grab it by its header and drag it to a new position. In a future version of the context menu, it’ll remember its last position (much like the ACSS dashboard does).",

Start by turning on Variable Expansion in the dashboard under Options > Workflow Enhancements: Workflow Enhancements Panel Now, you can stop typing and expressions in the builder. Using variable expansion in input fields​ In an input field, you can expand any variable by typing the stem (e.g. “–primary”) and hitting the Enter key. ACSS will automatically turn “” into “.” For calculations, you can simply type the calculation. For example, ACSS will turn “” into “.” You can also use variable stems and math at the same time. ACSS will turn “” into ““. Using variable expansion in CSS​ CSS and code blocks also support variable expansion. The difference is that expansion happens when closing a line with “;” instead of with the Enter key. Let’s say you’re going to type “” as a property value. Sometimes people expect the to expand to as they go, or they try to hit enter to trigger it. This is incorrect/unnecessary. All you have to do is finish typing the entire value and then close off the value with “;” as you normally do when writing CSS. The “;” will trigger the expansion of everything within the string. String validation​ This feature also provides validation to ensure that your and expressions are accurate and won’t throw CSS errors. If an expression is invalid, you’ll see warnings for an incorrect number of brackets. This is tremendously helpful at catching errors and potentially creating stylesheet breakage with invalid s.",
